Where'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all [Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you [Verse 2]
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken [Pre-Chorus]
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all (at all) [Chorus]

I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you [Verse 3]
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
I'm doing better without you, you, you [Chorus]
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh (so much better)
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh (woah)

I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh (trippin on you, tripping on you)
With you with you oh without you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
Don't text, take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby, don't stress
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
Baby don't shy, oh

Oh, believe in me
Guaranteeing in my loyalty

Every (?) will achieve
Don't hesitate to follow my lead
How many times you don't want me to leave?
You don't want me to leave, no [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see (only girl I see)
I'm the only guy that you need (I'm the only guy that you need)
And there's a viable term in me

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby take it slow so we can last long Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso
Oh, yeah Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye! Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, "¡Ay, Bendito!"
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Bailalo! Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos
(Favorito, favorito, baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)

And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls? 'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much

I see it happening everyday, nothing lasts forever
That's what people say
I can't picture you out of my life
I think about this every day and night
And I don't know why but it seems to get to me
No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone
So I'm staying with you till you want me to go Girl, you don't understand what you do to me

I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm, I'm in love Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again Just a fraction of your love
Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again, woo woo woo
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life that I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me,
Is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa Before you're love was low
Playing girls was my high
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side, aye
When broken hearts rise up to say,
Love is a lie
You and I would stand to be love's reply Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up
And to all the heart aching
Jealous females hatin'
Imma hold it down for you, you
You, woah, oh, woah
You're the common denominator
Oh yeah woah I don't wanna go back
I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, without you I'm lost
Can't face this compass at heart
Between me and love,
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woa Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no press, ain't that serious Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company It ain't about the complications

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby give me one last hug There's a dream
That I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
(Reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand
That it's meant to be Cause baby when you're with me

So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting 'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
'Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But there's one thing that I know for sure I'll show you
I'll show you Lately I've been thinking,thinking about what we had
And I know it was hard, it was all that we knew,yeah! Have you been drinking, to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah! You know there's no one, I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you for me, together I gave you everything babe
Well, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be Tell me, was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me, together There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me, together You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so you can fly away?
You gotta make a decision

Oh oh oh
And I pray I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
Its in the papers, its on the TV,
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray I lose my appetite,
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner,
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference
And its starting today 'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change? I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that a piece of you's gone,
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall What's gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
You're not gon' be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall, In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me

Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion, deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my Like a permanent stain
Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
And our love was in vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time Like a permanent stain
Wishin' I could just wash away
Away
Hate or love was insane
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain? If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant
Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
Been you [Chorus]
You're the only girl that I see
I'm the only guy that you need
And there's a viable term in me
Said you want this
Don't text, take a deep breath
'Cause I don't need you to stress, hey hey
Baby, don't stress
Stress out over me [Verse 1]
So when I invite you
Baby don't shy, oh
Open your mind, don't knock it till you try it, darling

Oh, believe in me
Guaranteeing in my loyalty

Want me to leave, no [Chorus]

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now 'Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe

Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pin drop
'Cept for the clock on the wall
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas I'm praying that you make it home tonight

I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that, that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that, I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because, because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
