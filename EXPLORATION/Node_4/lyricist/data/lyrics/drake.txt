Listen, seein' you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah
Tension between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no [Verse 2]
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance
I think we should rule out commitment for now
'Cause we're fallin' apart
Leavin', you're just doin' that to get even
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now
They keep fallin' apart [Chorus]
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no [Outro]
Tryin' to think of the right thing to say [Hook: Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me [Verse: Drake]
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on my road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin' the script like a read-through
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah [Hook: Jorja Smith]
These things'll fall down
But you'll pick 'em up
You're still here to touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know you're trying to help me
I know, I know [Outro: Drake]
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Intro]
Ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin', with like, some pimpin' to it, or something? That you can relax, pop a top to, or something? [Verse 1]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me [Hook]
Nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way
Sha-nah-nah nah-nah-nah, sha-nah-nah-nah
Can't just leave it off that way, nah [Verse 2]
At least do I get an invitation or something
A statement or something
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothin' that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way... [Hook]

Skrrt [Intro: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 1: Drake]
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray [Hook: Drake]
That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Bridge: Kyla]
Baby I like your style [Verse 2: Drake]
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time [Hook: Drake]
And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me [Break: Wizkid]
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl [Bridge: Kyla + Wizkid]
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down

Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing Ever since I left the city I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost I've asked about you and they've told me things
But my mind didn't change
I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushing me away so I give her space
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thanking you, just don't know
Trying to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry,
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes 'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know,
You hate being alone, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin' to save you
Instead they say [Intro: Nai Palm]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain
Using you high to be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release
And in your wake, ripple your sweet voice
And more chune for your head tops
So watch how you speak on my name, you know? [Verse 1]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin' up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 2]
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden hills where I post
Iced up, my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake, though
Miraval to the face, though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows and front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin' our name on a double cup
We ain't even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin' me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 3]
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lotta niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die [Hook]
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye!
Free smoke, free smoke, aye! [Verse 4]
Hidden hills where I post, yeah
Ye already know, yeah

Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah
Y'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah

This is not to get confused
This ones for you Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up

And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (yup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one they never get confused wit 'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best
You the da best I ever had,
Best I ever had, best I ever had, best I ever had
I say you da fuckin' Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time I say, you da fuckin' best you da fuckin' best

But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
In your city faded off the brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo,
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo,
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah nigga I'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness,
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness,
Bitches, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came,
I went hard all fall like the ball teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, what, nothin',
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't,
You're such a fucking loser,
He didn't even go to class Bueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,

I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden,
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target,
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops,
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention,
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last, It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne, There they go, packing stadiums,
As Shady spits his flow,
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic wow,
We can make them look like bozos,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
Fuck no go for broke,
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion and the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot,
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin',
And spit true feelings,
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face,
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake. It may not mean nothing to y'all,
But understand nothing was done for me,
So I don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this shit forever mayne, ever mayne, ever mayne,
I'm shutting shit down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And I ain't even planning to call,

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing 'cause
I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse
But man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man I guess I'm an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like
"What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin'
September, just wait on it

Hundred inch TV at my house
I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit

Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando

Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace

No offset no preacher but you niggas listen
Them blue and white diamonds, they look like the Pistons
Codeine sippin, Versace I'm gripping them bands in my pocket
You know that I'm living
I'm draped up in gold, but no Pharaoh
Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload
I think I'm the don, but no Rocco
This the life that I chose,
Bought out the store, can't go back no more
Versace my clothes while I'm selling them bows
Versace took over, it took out my soul Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace I love you so much!
But I hate what you've done
I know from here things will never be the same
And things will probably never change
I know what we want
Isn't exactly what god had planned
Hey its all I can do is
Hope you can see the difference
And pray for the best
Please don't forget me! I won't soothe your pain
I won't ease your strength Drake:
I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl
I live in L.A
You in Chicago
You're not patient
I'm not patient
We shouldn't be together
I think we shouldn't be together
No more no (no more no)
Just think I'm where it all beginning
You're the envy of your prince
Plus you know you're not yourself anymore
The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry girl
(yeah)
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
(Drake: but always end up preventing me from achieving them)
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last word
And if I tell you how I really felt
(there probably end up being another argument candy girl,
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I don't mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with ?
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES Drake:
Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear You know how they say
If you love somebody
That don't love you back
Love them anyway I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a f*** and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this s***, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, oh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that

You and me, only

Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, But I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby Yeah, it really sucks whenever since I've been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you we're a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I'm feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can't help it if you're really ashamed
All the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don't match
Is it the money, want me to give it back? This shit was all I knew
You and me, only
I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We can work it out
Uhh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
Say say something, baby, say something, baby, say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby
I'm gonna need you to say something, baby I am the topic of conversation
This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's 'all about location'
I'm sitting, drink wine and watch Californication of life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, fifty fifty
But now I'm at the forty forty getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing? I got my eyes on you,
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you,

Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?
I lost my way I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (Think about me)
Ah please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Say to you
But 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you
The Mercedes coupe that you still drivin' was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Took up with Jessica, Kim, you know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Ah yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Ah please give me time
'Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell 'em if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since 'Take Care' I've been care-taking
But second chances, that ain't how you livin' Redemption on your mind I'll never be forgiving Yeah, I know Uh
Uh huh, uh huh
Look (Drake: Verse 1)
I let the beat bang
I don't claim colors
Honestly, the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter
But when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi Coast
Couple days on the beach
Then its adiios
(Killa)
Just look at what I done alone
You would swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees, no honeycomb
And you could probably feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs
Drizzy (Drake chorus)
Uh
I'm tryina bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a mufuckin
Killa
Killa
Killa
Killa
Uh
And I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around
Shit'll never be the same
I'm a.

(Listen, look) (Nipsey Hussle Verse 2)
Before rap,
My last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success
It look like right now
What was once gray skies
Is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones y'all said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps
And you see what I'm bout
I keep my money comin' in
And never goin' out
From Chuck Taylors on the pavement with the blammers out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops bunk you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over-shine
Been fuck bitches
I been on my grind

It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, bitch I'm the man
Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always getting faded Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me Okay look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me, ooh
Take a shot for me
A shot for me

Looking for a guy to put in work-a
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that, I'd never make you feel like that 'Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you've been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Yeah I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I can take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love Thinking 'bout Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we talked about something we disagreed on
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living I just hope I'm forgiven
It seems like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh? I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love "Been Bocka AKA Not Nice from Timegiene been a East Side ting,

So hard to breathe this air that we call love,
Aint nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love,
When you get hurt by the one you living for,
Pain can make you wanna love no more, [Chorus]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2) Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly,
So many lonely sleepless nights,
Im going through hell to convince you love me,
But never her approval no matter how I try,
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
Im ashamed you can see it in my eyes,
Momma always told me to respect the woman,
But what am I to do when her parents do not try, So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say,
Oooooohhh [Chorus] Ive been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life aint the same as you are,
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
If I cant have what mean most to me, So many tears I cried,
But all for nothing Im afraid to say, [Chorus] [Drake]
Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause Ive drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And theres pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear thats sittin in the dryer
How come every time that youre suspicious Im a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And thats the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what Im gone do
Since everything Im trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one Im missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then well be for sure [Chorus]
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just cant be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself,
(x2) [End] All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only 'hello' or 'happy belated'
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessey and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you?
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit' you? (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right (And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Damn right, all right

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit Cause I'm on one
F-ck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So your the only one Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded Uh Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
ooooh ooooh trust issues When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (oh ho, oh ho) We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different (Oh ho, oh ho) [Hook]
You know you know
You know you know [Drake - Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but im still playin' like im bein' scouted til im outted
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook]
[Drake - Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that '62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is
They ain't rooting for me, they ain't clapping for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know [Hook] I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changing your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we should have just did things my way
Instead of the other way I tried with you
There's more than life than sleeping in
And getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate Throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say it's guaranteed
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah

This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit, one shit
All my niggas wanna do is pop style, pop style
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle, lifestyle Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum, they do
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man you boys just got to Hollywood
You boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me They still out to get me, they don't get it
I can not be gotten, that's a given
They like Pablo why are all the windows tinted in your Tahoe?
Why do you know every single bitch that I know?
Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago, aye
South, south, side, that's the motto, aye
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life and preach the gospel, cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect) Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down
Get down, have her lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now
So much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now?
Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now?
What more can I say now?

Aston Martin music, music (all night)
Aston Martin music, music
In our ride "Good God Almighty, like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R; men to tell you what to play
How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock
But um, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know
Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much
As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow" Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Sean Don, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shoutout to Worldwide Wes
Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us"
I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icing on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake
Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Bigg made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

I'm with you Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping in to your emotions
Dry cry 'cause I'm hopeless
Choosy your lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you around, I need you, oh "That's the shit I'm talking about though, like
You changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more,
You just dash me away like a cyattie.
Yo, you cheesed me dog." Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you, shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the Bar exam, I drove in the snow for you? Yeah you probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then, girl, how 'bout now?
'Cause I'm up right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)
Oh you thought you had it all figured back then girl, how 'bout now
'Cause I'm right now ('cause I'm up right now)
And you suck right now (and you suck right now)

Yeah, girl how 'bout now
How 'bout now girl, what 'bout now girl, how 'bout now Yeah always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas, he ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from acting, I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CD's of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh word, true shit?"
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year, guess
I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
You ain't really fucked with me way back then but I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up, I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up, pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control If I can give everything back to you
All this passion I got, all I ever needed
For me to move on and succeed
For me to move on and succeed
Jealousy, envy and greed
Too much of that shit I don't need it I turned on the gas with a nickle plated
I sit back and laugh 'cause these niggas traitors
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
Mentally, none of this shit can phase me
I came out of trenches, I really made it
I come out the gutter, I really made it
I stack up the butter, I gotta save it
Stack up the cheddar, you gotta save it
Shoot out the car with no lovey dovey
These bitches, they lookin' for hubbie hubbie
I'm lookin' for paper in any city
I got a bitch located in every city
Gotta have 'em sticks on us in every city
Take the private, it's ugly out here we gettin' it
Spent like seven hundred thousand on both the Bentleys
I got love for the city, I juug and get it I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money, man I'm already rich
I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love with the dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
Wake up and pray every morning
Demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control I need acknowledgement, If I got it then tell me I got it then
I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships
Mail comin' to the house, nigga please, watch your mouth
I'm the one without a doubt, yeah
And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes
Drafted, I'm gettin' choose by these hoes
Usually they just leave when we done
I don't wanna share no room with these hoes
Metro gon' make it boom on these hoes
And me, I just stick and move on these hoes
We got that purple rain for the pain
My niggas, we ain't change, we ain't change I wake up on a daily basis

I go so hard with these riches
I fell in love as a dodie
I fell in love with the Rollie
I wake up pray every morning
These demons, they callin' my soul
I said fuck all of you hoes
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control
I'm ballin' outta control, I'm ballin' outta control Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Done saying, I'm done playing
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet but I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out" Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing
Look, I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore Always saw you for what you could have been
Ever since you met me like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like a Bentley I
Always saw you for what you could have been
And even when its business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now were meeting out end And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine Your so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm goin' through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judged me before you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in LA I don't know whats going on I don't know whats going on
And its all becase you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time, yeah
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you you couldn't give me any advice
You always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving tomorrow like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved you I'll always love you that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling a way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should have tried to keep my family closer, much closer
All of my let's just be friends
Are friends I don't have anymore
Guess it's what they say you need family for
'Cause I can't depend on you anymore

You would think I planned it
I'm just doin' me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered
Big dick bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds n**** I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it movin' like a drive-by
I just tell the truth so I'm cool in every hood spot
Twenty one years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me I'm goin' in and I ain't f***in' with no hood cops I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
B****, I'm goin' in (jizzle)
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in (I'm goin' in)
I'm goin' in (I'm goin' in)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (and I'm a go hard) It goes hold up wait one motherf***in' minute
It's the el capatain
I got motherf***in' lieutenants
If I said I'm goin in then I motherf***in' meant it
And if I brought it in the club
Then I'm a motherf***in' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands
And I'm motherf***in' in it
No need for a room
Yea you know I'm f***in' in it
She actin' like she not but she know she f***in' with it
She said I seen it all
I said no you f***in' didn't
You ever busted nuts in a two seater
She said I can't feel my legs
I'm like b**** me neither
I'm goin' in
Where should I begin
I don't even know maybe where my blunt ends
And I'm a be a legends even when my life ends
And I'm a be a legend even when this night ends
Til I do my thing hop up out it like biem,
B**** I said I'm him so I'm nothin' like them
I'm goin' in! I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard
B****, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard (hard)
And I'm a go hard
And I'm a go hard (yea, yea) Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, hoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Wooh, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to man [Woman on phone]
"Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out?' yeah, I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious night" [Drake - Verse 1]
Cups of the Rosy
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around" (Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say "Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say, "fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"
(Are you drunk right now?) I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on [Drake and Woman on phone]
"Well I'm sorry" [Drake]
"Are you drunk right now?" [Woman] I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me [Drake on phone]
"You're not going to come?"
"Guess I'm bout to just kick it here then" Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble [Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling hands
I was dope when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a canadian
That gave him an addiction
That would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rhianna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when your my type
And you win it from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Channel
Live the ambiance all cause the audiance
One day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
Ima go 'n get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and you weave look good
With the indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word
Like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black maybach 40 pulled up G
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation
A reality living in the matrix
We talk casualy about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as myself
And it didn't help cuz it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on mr OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing on the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason was the highlight was when he said
You alone to the people till you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died
