Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues

Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do. And when you walk around the world, babe,
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road,
You might find out later that the road'll end in detroit,
Honey, the road'll even end in kathmandu.
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,
When you only gotta do one thing well,
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.
You got a woman waiting for you there,
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe,
I know you got more tears to share, babe,
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
And cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby. Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed It's the heart, afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong Just remember, in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lie the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose Sitting down by my window,
Whoa, whoa, looking at the rain.
Whoa, down by my window, baby,
And all around me,
I said suddenly I felt the rain.
Somethin' grabbed a hold of me, darling,
Honey, it felt to me, honey like, yeah, a ball and chain.
Oh honey, you know what I mean,

Whoa, it can't be, babe,

Whoa, baby, it just can't be
Every time I want to reach out my hand.
No, no, no, no, no, babe, baby, never, no, no,
Never, never, no, no, no.

All right, daddy, take it all! I'll tell you something, man,
I never expected that out of Toronto, man.
You're looking real good, real good
In fact you're all invited to my house for a drink.
I live in San Francisco and if you can get there man,
I'll give you the drink.
I promise.
I ain't too hard to find, ha ha ha ha ha
I'm all over the streets, man.
Ha Ha. I'm not. A while back, it was about a year ago,
I think it was, I had this apartment in San Francisco,
I lived on the third floor in this little tiny apartment building,
Had a little two rooms and a dog, right. I lived on the third floor and I used to walk around town and I had,
You know, a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple T-shirts
And I thought I had my shit pretty good together, man. You know I was out on the streets talking and talking,
Doing all that shit, and every time I found a nice piece of talent
He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor,
There was another chick on the second floor, right. And I couldn't understand, I couldn't understand,
I kept thinking, Janis, why are you doing wrong suddenly ?
Well I so decided to get up one morning, ha ha ha,
And check out the chick's action, right,
Figure out what she had going that I didn't have going. I got up at 9:30 in the morning,
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part.
And I got up at 9:30 in the morning,
I hid in the stairwell right next
To the chick's across from her apartment, right.
And I watched her and watched to see what she had, man,
That I didn't have. And I'll tell you what she had man,
That chick hit the streets at noon.
I mean I didn't use to get up till three.
That chick was already in the street hustling, man.
So I figured out what you gotta do, man.
Every time you're looking for a little piece of action
And you ain't getting none, man,
You know what you better do, baby,
You better try harder, man. Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday. Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name.
Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday. I'm gonna lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind. Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always.
Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away! Time keeps moving on,
Friends they turn away,
Well, I keep moving on
But I never found out why
I keep pushing so hard a dream,
I keep trying to make it right
Through another lonely day Whoa don't discover it lasts
Twenty-five years, uh honey just one night, oh yeah
Well I'm twenty-five years older now
So I know it can't be right
And I'm no better baby and I can't help you no more

'Cause I know that I could always try
It don't make no difference baby, yeah

Throw my love all around you, yeah. Well, a nickel is a nickel, a dime is a dime
I need a new man, Lord I know I won't mind.
Tell me how long, dear, do I have to wait ?
Can I get you now, dear, must I hesitate ? Well now, the eagle on the dollar says "In God we trust"
You say you won't obey me, you want to see that dollar first
How long, dear, do I have to wait ?
Can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate ? Lord, if the river was made of whiskey an' I was a duck,
I'd just swim to the bottom an' I'd never come up.
How long, dear, mm, do I have to wait ?
Why, can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate ? Now there's rocks down in the ocean and there's fish in the sea,
I know you mean the whole world to me.
How long, dear, must I have to wait ?
Can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate ? I got them Hesitation Stockings, I got them Hesitation Shoes,
Lord knows I got them Hesitation Blues.
Tell me, how long do I have to wait ?
Why, can I get you now, dear, mm, must I hesitate ? Yeah!

That sounds Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.
I may be seeing you around
When I change my living standard and I move uptown,

I guess I'm gonna make it somehow.
But you may not be with me, darling, when I do
'cause you're not with me now. Well, I know that Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.
I guess I'm gonna make it OK.
An' I'll see you in a funny place some old day,
So long, my honey, so long. Well, I get the feeling I could chase you clean on in the ball
And wind up staying pull off, put down strung out and stalled.
Honey, I ain't got time to wait on you or to fetch your super-ball,
I've got lots of things I've got to do. So long, my honey, so long.
I guess I'm gonna make it somehow
But you may not be with me darling when I do
'cause you're not with me now! So long, my honey, so long.
Too bad you had to drift away
'cause I could use some company
Right on this road, right on this road I'm on today, yeah! Well, I know that you got things to do and places to be
And I guess I'll have to find the thing you placed on me.
I may wind up in the street or sleep beneath a tree,
Still I guess you know, honey I've gotta go. Bye, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye.
Lord, I might've been your wife,
But you settled for a place right in my heart,
You didn't want a place in my life. So long, my honey, so long.
I guess you know you're on your own,
It seems you just got lost somewhere out in the world
And you left me here to face it all alone,

There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday

Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.

O talk to people more and go out more and, you know, your lifestyle's becomes more a come-out, flow-out thing instead of a hold-it-and-be-quiet type.
How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?
Did they make you different ?

She'll do crazy things, yeah, on lonely occasions.

She knows he's taking her for granted, yeah yeah,
Honey, she doesn't understand, no no no no! Well, the fevers of the night, they burn an unloved woman
Yeah, those red-hot flames try to push old love aside.

Later in the show.
Yeah, maybe later we'll be talking too. you're really shot after, after a number, let alone a whole evening I would think.
Yeah, yeah.
You tell me you kind of collapse after a show ?
Well, I'm used to it because I'm so turned on by doing one that it's hard to do, it's hard to stop after one to tell you the truth, because it just makes you wanna do more.
Your engine is revved up ?
Yeah, sort of!
I know all the hip expressions, you see. your engine is revved up.
You're a real swinger, I can tell by your shoes, man!
Wait a minute, janis, janis. these were good enough for my grand-father, they're good enough for me.
I had a lot of trouble, last week i, er, it wasn't that tune, we opened with another tune and I tore a muscle.
I heard about this. you tore a mussel somewhere near maryland. er ...
It was closer to home than that!
Well, er ...
But I played forty minutes, man! I did forty minutes!
Yeah, but how do you, how do you tear a muscle singing, was it from the exhaustion or ...
No, I went ... like that.
You actually, literally tore a muscle ... I mean like that ...
Every time, it hurt.
Could you feel it go ?
Yeah.
Phew!
Yeah.
What do they do, do they set a muscle or do they tape you up or something ?
They told me to keep still.
Janis you wrote that tune that you were just singing like we just agreed to ask about. you er, you wrote the first tune, right ?
I wrote the first tune. it's, er, yes I did, it's about men.
It's about men. it's a little hard to tell what it was about 'cause I was standing over there where the sound is a little distorted.
Well in my story that's what it is anyway.
Yeah.
D'you ever see those mule carts ?
Yeah.
They, er, there's a dumb mule on there right and a long stick with a string and a carrot, and it hangs over the mule's nose, and it runs after it all day long. some ...
Who is the man in this, in this parable, the mule, or the person holding the carrot ?
No, the woman is the, is the mule. chasing something that somebody's holds her way.
Constantly chasing her man ...
Yeah.
... who always eludes her.
Well, they always hold something more than they're prepared to give.
I have to defend my entire sex, ladies and gentlemen! the burden of the defense.
Go right ahead!
Well, one-arm wrestling I can take you two out of three.
I hope so.
Do you, er, do you actually sit down when you get up in the morning and, and write out a song, or do you . . . when you say you write it, you compose it you write it on a paper.
You just make it up, I don't write songs, I make them up.
They don't exist on paper your songs, don't they ?
Sometimes I just write down the words so I don't forget 'em, but I mean I don't write songs, that's a whole different concept. I just make 'em up.
Yeah. did you ever get back to port arthur, texas ?
No, but I'm going back next in august, man. and guess what I'm doin' ?

But a high school major in art does have plenty of time.
Yeah. and do you think you'll have a lot to say to your old high-school classmates ?
I don't have a lot, man.
You were not surrounded by friends in high school ?
They laughed me out of class, out of town, and out of state, man.

But I don't understand why you always pick the time
When I've just talked to you with your love on my mind.
To see a distant light, to hear a far-off horn
To leave me one more time, I can't stand no more
Say no more, well no more,
Well no more, darling, please.
And every time you leave I make the very same vow
That when you come back I ain't gonna love you no how.

Hold on to my heart, I'll believe it till you're leaving
Then I'll cry, yeah. Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine.
Go ahead! I don't want your golden mansions with a tear in every room,
All I want's the love you promised, beneath the halo moon.
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrow while you play your cheatin' game. Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
And I'll never drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine.
You can't buy my love with money, for I never was that kind,
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine. [Instrumental] Now when I go to work, I work all day,

Come back and believe the magic of love. Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Honey, welcome back home. I know she told you,
Honey I know she told you that she loved you
Much more than I did,
But all I know is that she left you,
And you swear that you just don't know why,
But you know, honey I'll always,
I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh honey, welcome back home. Don't you know, honey,
Ain't nobody ever gonna love you
The way I try to do ?
Who'll take all your pain,
Honey, your heartache, too ?
And if you need me, you know
That I'll always be around if you ever want me
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do. And when you walk around the world, babe,
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road,
You might find out later that the road'll end in detroit,
Honey, the road'll even end in kathmandu.
You can go all around the world
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,
When you only gotta do one thing well,
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.
You got a woman waiting for you there,
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman
And that'll be the end of the road, babe,
I know you got more tears to share, babe,
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
And cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby. ( recording of july 28 1966, san francisco )

And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee La da da
