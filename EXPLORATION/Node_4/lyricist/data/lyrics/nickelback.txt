The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I want to sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Mama gonna let you set the moon on fire Jack be nimble, jack be quick
Jack wound up with a broken neck
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing
Daddy gonna buy you a diamond ring Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale Suzie steamboat, you're so fine
Grant the wish I wish tonight
Tinker tailor, whatcha' got?
Wheels on the bus are falling off Pretty maids all in a row
Yes, sir, yes, sir three bags full
Silver spoon at supper time
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a fucking fairy tale All of your life has been rambling, scurrying
Take your time rather than hurry
Never too late to write the rest of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandonment
A ticket to life as the mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older) Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Old mistakes committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a gift that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Gonna have to come after the rain (rain, yeah)
Gonna have to come after the rain (rain)
Rain, yeah
Rain
Gonna have to come after the rain How could this affect my life?
How could I affect the outcome?
So why even try?
For what, for what, for what, for what?
A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So easy to say
So what, so what, so what? So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice is really the one to follow
Silence the noise
So what, so what, so what? So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
What if we, what if we, what if we What if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? Hurry up, the world needs this
Hurry up, the world needs this (the world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this) I'm through with standing in line
To clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth
And I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out
Quite the way I want it to be
(Tell me what you want) I want a brand new house
On an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough
For ten plus me
(So what you need?) I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club
At thirty-seven thousand feet
(Been there, done that) I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and
James Dean is fine for me
(So how you gonna do it?) I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name 'Cause we all just wanna be big rock stars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny in her bleach blond hair, and we'll
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star I want to be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
(I'll have the quesadilla) I'm gonna dress my ass
With the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to
Blow my money for me
(Does this make me look fat?)
(So how you gonna do it?) I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name Cause we all just wanna be big rock stars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star I'm gonna sing those songs
That offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills
From a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong Well, we all just want to be big rock stars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star
Hey, hey, I want to be a rock star This time, this place misused, mistakes
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know you know, you know That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore On my knees, I'll ask last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know you know, you know That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know I wanted, I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say
That I love you, I have loved you all along
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long
So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go (Keep breathing)
Hold on to me and never let me go Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head? This is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out And this is where I went to school
Most of the time I had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must of done it half a dozen times I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Lot's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye Remember the old arcade?
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They said somebody went and burnt it down We use to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just a steering wheel Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye I miss that town
I miss their faces
You can't erase
You can't replace it
I miss it now
I can't believe it
So hard to stay
Too hard to leave it If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change Every memory of lookin' out the back door
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye
Every memory of walkin' out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for
It's hard to say it
Time to say it
Good bye, good bye, good bye Look at this photograph
Every time I do it makes me laugh
Every time I do it makes me My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day) Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
I wish you'd unclench your fists
And unpack your suitcase
Lately there's been too much of this
But don't think it's too late Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when Well, I'd hope that since we're here anyway
We could end up saying
Things we always needed to say
So we could end up staying
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that) How the hell'd we wind up like this
Why weren't we able
To see the signs that we missed
Try and turn the tables
Now the story's played out like this
Just like a paperback novel
Let's rewrite an ending that fits
Instead of a Hollywood horror Nothing's wrong just as long as you know that someday I will Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
Someday, somehow
I'm gonna make it alright but not right now
I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that) I know you're wondering when
(You're the only one who knows that)
I know you're wondering when Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without
A sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and
I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
'Cause living with him must have
Damn near killed you And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no
Yet, yet, yet, no no Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
And this is how you remind me
This is how you remind me This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong

These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet
Are we having fun yet
Yet, yet, no, no I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cuttin' yourself with the jagged edge
I'm tellin' you that it's never that bad
And take it from someone who's been where your at
You're laid out on the floor and you're not sure
You can take this anymore So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reachin' out to let you know
That you're not alone And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinkin' about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done, you're far too young
And the best is yet to come So just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reachin' out to let you know
That you're not alone And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby Well everybody's hit the bottom
And everybody's been forgotten
Well everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hangin', on Just give it one more try
With a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now
I'm reachin' out to let you know
That you're not alone And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your Time, is going by, so much faster than I,
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you.
Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you.
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know You're never gonna be alone!
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall,
You're never gonna be alone!
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone. And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know You're never gonna be alone!
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall,
When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone Oh,
You've gotta live every single day,
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Don't let it slip away,
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun
Every single day,
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?
Tomorrow never comes Time, is going by, so much faster than I,
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you. You're never gonna be alone!
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,
I won't let you fall,
When all hope is gone
I know that you can carry on
We're gonna take the world on
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone I'm gonna be there all the way,
I won't be missing one more day,
I'm gonna be there always,
I won't be missing one more day. I am so high, I can hear heaven
I am so high, I can hear heaven
Whoa, but heaven, no, heaven don't hear me And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away Someone told me love would all save us
But, how can that be, look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as we all fly away And they're watching us
(watching us)
They're watching us
(watching us)
As we all fly away And they're watching us
(watching up)
They're watching us
(watching us)
As we all fly away And they're watching us
(watching us)
They're watching us
(watching us)
as we all fly away This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like deja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with 'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough ('cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me, oh Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's gotta be somebody for me out there Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you, well I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you, come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin' and all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And, oh, I scream for you come please,
I'm callin' and all I need from you, hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me Hurry, I'm fallin'
And all I need is you
Come please, I'm callin'
And, oh, I scream for you
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin' Show me what it's like
To be the last one standing
And teach me wrong from right
And I'll show you what I can be
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me, hurry, I'm fallin' Say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth saving me I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you
That I've been kissing
Screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered what was that
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
That's my dad outside the car
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in Lying awake, did it again for Christ sake
Shoulda told her to go, and I know it
But she tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home
I did what I did, can't stay in and I'm just a kid
Saw the lie in my eyes, couldn't hide it
'Cause you tasted like home
Yeah, she tasted like home Oh well, home ain't what I'm callin'
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this life
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone
In a house that's not a home The pain in my heart 'cause we're a thousand miles apart
I've got no one to blame for the shame
'Cause she's waiting back home
I hope she's waiting back home
Stupid to think that I could blame it on the drink
Now I'm trying to stall, making calls to someone back home
I hope there's someone back home Oh well, home ain't what I'm callin'
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this life
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone, in a house that's not a home I walk through the door and there's no light on anymore
Must have known all along that I was wrong
'Cause there's no one at home
No one's waiting back home Well, home ain't what I'm callin'
But I'm the only ghost walkin' through the hallways
The pain gets so much clearer
When the one to blame is standing in the mirror
This fool, this life
Lit a match and set his life on fire
I guess I'd rather be alone
In a house that's not a home From underneath the trees, we watch the sky
Confusing stars for satellites
I never dreamed that you'd be mine
But here we are, we're here tonight Singing Amen, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I'm alive If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
And I'm singing Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive And in the air the fireflies
Our only light in paradise
We'll show the world they were wrong
And teach them all to sing along Singing Amen, I, I'm alive (I'm alive)
Singing Amen, I, I'm alive If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died And as we lie beneath the stars
We realize how small we are
If they could love like you and me
Imagine what the world could be If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died
If everyone cared and nobody cried
If everyone loved and nobody lied
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
Then we'd see the day when nobody died Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day, we'd see the day
When nobody died
Then we'd see the day when nobody died One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Mama gonna let you set the moon on fire Jack be nimble, jack be quick
Jack wound up with a broken neck
Humpty Dumpty, do your thing
Daddy gonna buy you a diamond ring Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale Suzie steamboat, you're so fine
Grant the wish I wish tonight
Tinker tailor, whatcha' got?
Wheels on the bus are falling off Pretty maids all in a row
Yes, sir, yes, sir three bags full
Silver spoon at supper time
Four and twenty blackbirds, oh, so high Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale One step, two step, electric slide
Red fish, blue fish, blow your mind
Engine, engine, number nine
Stick your diamond ring where the sun don't shine Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a goddamn fairy tale Oh, it must be nice
To spend each day in paradise
You wonder why you've ever failed
Your life's a fucking fairy tale The first words that come out
And I can see this song will be about you
I can't believe that I can breathe without you
But all I need to do is carry on
The next line I write down
And there's a tear that falls between the pages
I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
But it depends which one I'm standing on I write lines down, then rip them up
Describing love can't be this tough I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I'm dying to show you
This could end happily ever after
There doesn't ever have to be disaster
And all you have to do is sing along I write lines down, then rip them up
Impossible describing love I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes
Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost
Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke
I could throw it in the river and watch it sink in slowly
Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
Play it for the world, but it won't mean much
Unless I sing this song to you I could set this song on fire
Unless I sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this
I want to sing this song to you
I could set this song on fire
Sing this song to you
I could set this, I could set this You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more? But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to 'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
But if there's a pill to help me forget,
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to It's trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more So I sit here divided, just talking to myself
Was it something that I did?
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear
Tonight I'm dying to tell you That trying not to love you, only went so far
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more
Only makes me love you more What are you waiting for wow oh (oh oh oh)

What are you, what are you
What are you, what are you waiting for? Since the moment I spotted you
Like walking around with little wings on my shoes
My stomach's filled with the butterflies
And it's alright Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lie Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I hold each other
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in When's this fever gonna break?
I think I've handled more than any man can take
I'm like a love sick puppy chasing you around
And it's alright Bouncing round from cloud to cloud
I got the feeling like I'm never gonna come down
If I said I didn't like it then you'd know I'd lie Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I get together
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in Slowly I begin to realize
This is never gonna end
But about the same time you walk by
And I say, "Oh, here we go again, oh" Every time I try to talk to you I get tongue-tied
Turns out that everything I say to you
Comes out wrong, it never comes out right So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I get together
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in So I say why don't you and I get together
Take on the world and be together forever
Heads we will, tails we'll try again So I say why don't you and I get together
Fly to the moon and straight on to heaven
'Cause without you they're never gonna let me in "No" is a dirty word ,
Never gonna say it first,
"No" is just a thought that never crosses my mind.
Maybe in the parking lot,
Better bring your friend along,
Better all together than just one at a time. S is for the simple need.
E is for the ecstasy.
X is just to mark the spot,
Cause that's the one you really want.
(Yes) sex is always the answer, it's never a question,
Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's (yes)
Not just a suggestion, if you ask the question,
Then it's always yes, yeah! I'm loving what you wanna wear,
I wonder what's up under there?
Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?

So, so, I do

So, so, I do
I miss you
So I just woke up from a dream today
Time gone by but you still look the same
Felt so real to have you back with me
It's just too bad it's just another dream
Give me just one wish If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you
That I I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
(I miss you, so, so, I do) so, so, I do
I miss you
So, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do After dark, laughin' in the rain
Silver heart locket on a chain
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away
Give me just one wish If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so, so, I do If there was some way, you know I would
I'd do it today, I wish I could
I call out your name, it does no good
I wish I knew what would I, I miss you so much
God knows I do, I
I wish my wish was enough
Give me just one wish If I could give it all away
I'd do it just for one more day
Trade it in for one more moment
Tell you what I never told ya
All the things I left unsaid
I meant to say before you left
I thought I had the time to wait
Now it's too late to tell you I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you
I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you) God knows I do
I miss you so, so, I do
(I miss you)I miss you so much
I miss you so, so, I do
I miss you so All of your life has been rambling, scurrying
Take your time rather than hurry
Never too late to write the rest of your story
Remember to breathe or else you're gonna be sorry
Life's no race, it's a companion
Always face with reckless abandonment
A ticket to life as the mother once told me
Stick with your pride and you're gonna be lonely Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Spend your days happy and grateful
Avoid the taste of wanting and wasteful
Every good thing will come in moderation
Envy and greed will only lead to frustration
Choose your friends, carefree and kindly
Choose your words, careful and wisely
Always be there to lend a comforting shoulder
One will be there to share a day when you're older (a day when you're older) Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Old mistakes committed upon us
Always take a toll on the conscience
Every regret is a gift that you live with
Never forget to remember forgiveness Everybody says that life takes patience
But nobody wants to wait
Everybody says we need salvation
But nobody wants to be saved
The light in the tunnel is just another runaway train
The blue skies we wait on
Are gonna have to come after the rain Gonna have to come after the rain (rain, yeah)
Gonna have to come after the rain (rain)
Rain, yeah
Rain
Gonna have to come after the rain Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked 'em all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon You better hang on if your taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Just not tough to put the brakes on,
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again Just sitting around, hangin' out this afternoon Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR
Had a few, to Suzy Q this afternoon You better hang on if your taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Just not tough to put the brakes on,
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again Yeah we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down
So we can do it all again It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out
Just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon You better hang on if your taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long
Just not tough to put the brakes on,
Doesn't matter when you'd rather
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again Yeah we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Just sitting around
Get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon
Sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose Ouh, and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck) And I love your lack of self respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck Ouh and I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why And I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me
You're like my favorite damn disease And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can't say "No" too many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose Ouh and now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
Now I did, you wonder why
Why not before, you never tried
Gone for good, and this is it
Ooh Addressing those beneath from high above
Convincing his belief for what you love
Baiting every hook with filthy lies
Another charlatan to idolize Is this suppression just in my mind? (just in my mind?)
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!) You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine) The gears forever turn to grind the mice
Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
Power absolutely all for show
The piper blows his flute and off you go Is this obsession behind your eyes? (behind your eyes?)
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!) You pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine) Why must the blind always lead the blind?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
Why must the weakest be sacrificed?
(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
No more questions, get back in line! (just get back in line!) Pay with your life
The duller the knife, the longer it takes (the longer it takes)
But now it's your turn
The ashes will burn, and wither away (wither away)
Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)
And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)
To feed the machine (Hey, hey) She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor
It's the only way to LA that she knows
The Hollywood pose, teeth, tits, and toes
Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
So many five star friends with black credit cards
She'd try anything once, 'cause anything goes
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold (Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands (Hey, hey) I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look
Every A list player is a favorite friend
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
Her congressman will call her every once in a while
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
She's done everyone once, and everyone knows
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold (Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands Someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands. Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as
A poor man stealing
Tired of living like a blind man
I'm sick of sight without
A sense of feeling
And this is how you remind me This is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong
I've been down
Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no It's not like you didn't know that
I said I love you and
I swear I still do
And it must have been so bad
Cause living with him must have
Damn near killed you And this is how you remind me
Of what I really am
This is how you remind me
Of what I really am It's not like you to say sorry
I was waiting on a different story
This time I'm mistaken
For handing you
A heart worth breaking
And I've been wrong

Into the bottom of every bottle
These five words in my head
Scream
Are we having fun yet? Yeah, yeah, yet, no no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no Never made it as a wise man
I couldn't cut it as

Are we having fun yet? Yeah, yeah
Are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah
Are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah
Are we having fun yet?
Yeah, yeah, no, no I know it's late but something's on my mind
It couldn't wait, there's never any time
'Cause life slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite. Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite. Do you recall how long it must have been
Since any room held only you and me?
And every song that sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means.
Let's lock the door behind us,
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we Dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go
Until the morning light.
You can be my whole world
If I can be your satellite. Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight's our only night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite. Dance around the moon,
You and I every night
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite I cant believe that days took into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay
Inside this atmosphere Dance around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite Dance with me around the moon,
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room,
I'll be your satellite Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom,
I'll be your satellite Flying down the highway like a bat out of hell
My buddy Bradley's in the middle
Darcy's lookin' out the window
We just got high and hopin' no one can tell
But with the icky of the sticky
It don't matter where the wind blows Lighter in my hand and I've got nothing to burn
Except a little turpentine inside of those five paint cans
Get grandpa's shotgun and we'll all take turns
But don't you ever say a word
'Cause you know momma's gonna hate that The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In 3, 2, 1 We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman Countin' every nickel, dime and five dollar bill
So we've been stealin' gasoline and laying low out on the backroads
The city lights are glowin' over the hill
And we can make it, but we take the chance of never coming back home The dice that we've been rollin'
With our lives are better stolen
When you're walking through the fire for fun
Tidal wave in motion
You can't hide from the explosion
In 3, 2, 1 We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman One for the road and one for those in heaven
One for the lord and take it from the devil
Don't even try, 'cause you know you can't hide
Better run, better run, better run We're smokin' dynamite
Too many fuses to light
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
Gonna steal, beg, and borrow
A thousand fahrenheit and we're about to ignite
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know (the one thing I know)
We're smokin' dynamite
(Got kingdom come, on the run)
A thousand fahrenheit
So keep the throttle to the bottom
We may never see tomorrow
If tonight's our time to go, the one thing I know
We'll need a coin for the ferryman
Leave us a coin for the ferryman One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no getting even
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win They tell us every thing's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no getting even
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is leading on
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat) (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no getting even
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win Like a gift from the heavens it was easy to tell,
It was love from above that could save me from hell.
She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me. There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands. And we sang 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
And the voices rang like the angels sing.
And singin' 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
And we danced on into the night,
('Ay oh ay oh' x2)
And we danced on into the night! Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place,
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces.
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes,
No room left to move in between you and I. We forgot where we were and we lost track of time,
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night. And we sang 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay'
And our voices rang like the angels sing.
And singin' 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
And we danced on into the night,
('Ay oh ay oh' x2)
And we danced on into the night,
(Ay oh ay oh' x2)
And we danced on into the night! (GUITAR INSTRUMENTAL) Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
It was love from above that could save me from hell.
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me. There were drums in the air as she started to dance,

And our voices rang like the angels sing.
And singin' 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
And we danced on into the night! 'Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
[SAME TIME:
:Our voices rang like the angels sing.
:And we danced on into the night].
And singin' 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
And we danced on into the night! 'Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
('Ay oh ay oh')
'Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay'.
('Ay oh ay oh')
Singin' 'ay oh ay oh ay oh ay',
('Ay oh ay oh')
And we danced on into the night! She's got me nervous
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour
She's more than worth it
I swear she smells just like a flower
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her
I love when she says, what's wrong with right here on the counter? Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister
Coca-Cola roller-coaster
Love her even though I'm not supposed to. Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster

Sometimes I feel like I can taste it
This evil romance
So good I never wanna waste it
I can't trust my friends
'Cause she's what everybody chases
I know where she's been
'Cause it's on everybody's faces Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister

All night (All night)
All night (All night) Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now, this I vow By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you You know I'd always come for you No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
You know I'd always come for you Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to And I'd fight for you,
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you,
You know I'd always come for you No matter what gets in my way,
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you,
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you. Back in my hometown
The main street's dying down
It's like there's nothing left of it
No more high school grounds
They tore that building down
And everything we built
Well, I miss
I cut off my own friends
So lost inside seeing them
Feels like were back there instantly
To me We all need a chance
The backyard fires on
And we stop telling tales of how life used to be
But years have come and gone
But these stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've been fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speed's we were driving
But momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every penny i had always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
It was during those songs
It gets a little better
Every time we're together It's funny how we change
And some things stay the same
God, I miss the glory days
Always
Daylight getting near
We shed a few more tears
Lord, I love the memories we've made
The years have come and gone
But the stories carry on
Looking back, they're better than they used to be Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've been fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speed's we were driving
But momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every penny i had always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
It was during those songs
It gets a little better
Every time we're together Cause you shoulda seen the size of the guy's we've been fightin'
And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
But momma always taught us never to tell a lie
And every penny always turned into twenty
Every girl we were with never cost any money
And we drank more tequila than any man alive
And the story goes on
It gets a little better every time we're together
And the story goes on
It gets a little better every time we're together Father's hands are lined with dirt
From long days in the field
Mother's hands are serving meals
In a cafe on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad It's too bad it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You'd call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad It's too bad it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's so bad
It's too bad it's too bad
It's too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
(Let's talk) Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad It's too bad it's too bad
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's so bad
It's too bad it's too bad
It's too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk No time
Let's walk
Let's talk How could this affect my life?
How could I affect the outcome?
So why even try?
For what, for what, for what, for what?
A coward can save the day
When the bravest of men just stand by
So easy to say
So what, so what, so what? So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? A candle's the smallest light
But a handful becomes a lighthouse
Cutting the night for us, for us, for us, for us
The one with the loudest voice is really the one to follow
Silence the noise
So what, so what, so what? So what if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
Hurry up, the world needs this
Speak up now or we can pick up the pieces
What if we, what if we, what if we What if we all stand up?
What if we don't give in?
What if we trade it all?
Complacency for a voice that won't be ignored
How can we just give up?
How can we just give in?
What if the silent majority wasn't silent anymore? Hurry up, the world needs this
Hurry up, the world needs this (the world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this)
(The world needs this) He's drunk again, it's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him clenching his hands
She's just a woman, never again I hear her scream from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me go back to bed
I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands
She's just a woman, never again Been there before but not like this
Seen it before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you, she wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands
Lookin' just as sweet as he can, never again Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again
Never again Father's a name you haven't earned yet
You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard don't hit a lady
Kickin' your a** would be a pleasure He's drunk again, it's time to fight
Same old s***, just on a different night
She grabs the gun, she's had enough
Tonight she'll find out how f***in' tough is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can, never again Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again Seen it before but not like this
Been there before but not like this
Never before have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman, never again
Never again
Never again
Never again This time, this place misused, mistakes
Too long, too late, who was I to make you wait?
Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case there's just one left
'Cause you know you know, you know That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore On my knees, I'll ask last chance for one last dance
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
All of hell to hold your hand
I'd give it all I'd give for us
Give anything, but I won't give up
'Cause you know you know, you know That I love you I have loved you all along and I miss you
Been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming you'll be with me and you'll never go
Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
So far away, so far away
Been far away for far too long
But you know, you know, you know I wanted, I wanted you to stay
'Cause I needed, I need to hear you say
That I love you, I have loved you all along
And I forgive you, for being away for far too long
So keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving
Hold on to me and never let me go
Keep breathing, 'cause I'm not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me and
Never let me go, keep breathing
Hold on to me and never let me go (Keep breathing)
Hold on to me and never let me go Table has been set
Serving up the worst regret
Waiting for the chance
Serpents love the circumstance
Speaking to the sky
Slight of hand and cheap disguise
Naming of your price
Payment for the sacrifice Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You brought the wolves right here
You brought the kiss of death You just betrayed us (You just betrayed us)
The moment we rolled back waiting
No one can save us (No one can save us)
You won't believe us until we're gone
Go on, go on
You're noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed us (You just betrayed) Committed to your task
Jealousy behind your mask
Pieces are in place
Thirty for your last disgrace
Holding of your tongue
Dealing things that can be undone
Blood over your hands
Palm inside your master plan Demon in your ear
Evil on your breath
You brought the wolves right here
You brought the kiss of death You just betrayed us (You just betrayed us)
The moment we rolled back waiting
No one can save us (No one can save us)
You won't believe us until we're gone
Go on, go on
You're noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed us (You just betrayed) What have you caved?
What have you done?
Nothing but shame and there's no where to run
Who takes the blame?
Why have they come?
What in God's name have you done? You just betrayed us (You just betrayed us)
The moment we rolled back waiting
No one can save us (No one can save us)
You won't believe us until we're gone
Go on, go on
You're noose is waiting (no need to wait)
Go on, go on
You just betrayed us (You just betrayed) You just betray
You just betray
You just betray I like your pants around your feet
I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please while your lookin' up at me
your like my favorite damn disease
And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no to many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose [CHORUS]
Ohh I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
Just to figure you out
(Now and then, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard
just to figure you out
(Now and then, you wonder why) I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way your not impressed while you put em to the test
I like the white stains on your dress
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
(the good times that you wreck)
I love your lack of self-respect
While your passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck [CHORUS] I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While your looking up at me
your like my favorite damn disease
And I hate the places that we go
And I hate the people that you know
And I hate the way you can' say no to many long lines in a row
I hate the powder on your nose [CHORUS] Head high, protest line
"Freedom" scribbled on your sign

Standing on the edge of a revolution Hey, hey, just obey

Standing on the edge of a revolution Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,
My mind was closing, now I'm believing
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,
I'd search forever just to bring you home,
Here and now, this I vow By now you know that I'd come for you
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you
But only if you told me to
And I'd fight for you
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you
You know I'd always come for you You know I'd always come for you No matter what gets in my way
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember
You know I'd always come for you Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to And I'd fight for you,
I'd lie, it's true
Give my life for you,
You know I'd always come for you No matter what gets in my way,
As long as there's still life in me
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you
I'd crawl across this world for you,
Do anything you want me to
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you
You know I'd always come for you. I went out on the town with a friend last weekend.
His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone.
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling, she could really handle alcohol. Another one down and headed off the deep end.
The more we drank, the less that we had on. And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar.
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town.
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.
Gotta get me some. God all mighty look at that body.
Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari.
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun.
Hotter then a barrel on a squeeze machine gun. Well, she can get it lower then a Maserati.
Never seen somebody move that way.
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party.
Everybody wants to know her name. And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.
She's got a fast car, hotter then a dance bar.
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and She likes to get her hands up.
Anything to stand on.
Anything to dance on.
She'd be swinging around.
Under the hot lights, underneath the spot light.
Keep it going all night.
She'll be the talk of the town. You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.

Gotta get me some. I gotta get me some.
Gotta get me some. Stuck in a cage
Luck of the draw
Hours to wait
Gotta get out
Lord, I gotta fight one
Get me a key
Pick me a lock
Gotta be free, ready or not
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run Nowhere to hide 'cause someone's gotta find you
Trying to breathe when everybody's right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints
Water ahead 'cause I can hear it in the distance I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's been high and there ain't no goin' back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly, you can tell them that you drive
But there ain't no going back
They'll never catch me
Tell em that you tried, but you're never gonna catch me Let out the hounds
Stand up the guards
Stand up and bow
Better be boss like the Kennedy's
A fast one, now that the trees
Ended the swamp
Gotta be free
So don't ever never stop
Gotta run, gotta run
Gotta run, gotta run
God damn it, it's a fast one Nowhere to hide cause someone's gotta find you
Trying to breathe when everybody's right behind you
Scattering leaves to try and cover up the footprints
Water ahead because I can hear it in the distance I'm running for the river
'Cause the river's been high and there ain't no goin' back
They'll never catch me
I'm running for the river
You can ride, you can fly, you can tell them that you drive

Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
So hard to swallow So turn the television off
And I will sing a song
And if you suddenly have the urge
You can sing along I touch your hand, I touch your face
I think the fruit is rotten
Give me lessons on how to breathe
Cause I think I've forgotten
I think I've forgotten One day, up to a cliff
That overlooks the water
I jumped in to save a girl
It was somebody's daughter
And now the ring is on my hand
It was given to me by her
To this day we all sit around
And dream of ways to get higher
To get much higher Tell your friends not to think aloud
Until they swallow
Whisper things into my brain
Your voice sounds so hollow I am not a leader of men
Since I prefer to follow
Do you think I could have a drink
Since it's so hard to swallow
So hard to swallow Hey who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?

For a battle that you can't win
Swing as hard as you can swing
It will still mean nothing
Should've seen it coming
It had to happen sometime
But you went and brought a knife
To an all out gunfight And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave You've gone too far, who do you think you are
Is this what you came for, well this means war Say anything you want
But talk will get you nowhere
The only thing you brought is psychological warfare
Well there's no getting off
And now you got to wonder
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave You've gone too far, who do you think you are
Is this what you came for, well this means war And the only thing to save
Is the banner that you wave
To be wrapped around your grave You've gone too far, who do you think you are
Is this what you came for, well this means war
This means war One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win They tell us every thing's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night?
When somethings clearly wrong
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win The right thing to guide us
Is right here, inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is leading on
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on And the drumbeat carries on
(Just like a heartbeat) (Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hand in hand forever
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's when we all win
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's, that's, that's when we all win
That's, that's, that's when we all win Don't let it end.

It would be great if I could take you to this someday.
Well, I'll walk you home when the whole things done.
If you're there, I don't even care which team won. We could stop at the coffee shop.
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot.
We could laugh as we both pretend that we're not in love and that we're just good friends. Well, I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending.
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do, to ever let it end.
And I know you feel the same way, because you told me drunk on your birthday.
And as you pulled me near, whispered in my ear, don't ever let it end. Don't let it end.
Don't let it end.
Don't ever let it end. Saturday I'm gonna take her out.
'Cause her favorite band is gonna play downtown.
Gonna sing the song we've all heard, about those two young friends who should have fell in love. Later on we'll cut through the park.

You never know where life's gonna go, because we're the only ones who will ever know. About Sunday night, just her and I.
Sitting side by side in the full moon light.
I pulled her close just to hold her tight and the both of us could tell it just felt right.
She looked at me in the sweetest way.
Like should could tell what the hell I was about to say.
Must have took a while to find the words 'cause she cut me off and finally said it first. Well, I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending.
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do to ever let it end.
Yeah, you know I feel the same way, because I told you drunk on my birthday.

We gotta make love just one last time in the shower
Well something's gotta go wrong
'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good And it's like Every time I turn around

'Cause something's gotta go wrong
'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good Feelin' way too damn good Sometimes life ain't best if left in the memory

'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good Feelin' way too damn good Feelin' way too damn good I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this Well I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along, and tore this world out around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change
If you don't like, there's the door, nobody made you stay
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this Well I'm hating, all of this
I'm hating, all of this
All of this, all of this
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days

No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me
You came along, and tore this world out around me
Looks like you found me
Now I know why
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning He was my best friend, I tried to help him
But he traded everything, for suffering
And found himself alone
I watched the lying, turn into hiding
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips
Were melted to the bone But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high, (high) Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing
And pretended not to know
He started stealing, to supply the feeling
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife
And held it to her throat But I can still remember what his face looked like
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high (high) Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?
Show me!
What you really want, was it what you got?
Slowly!
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high, (high)
High, oh! (High, high)
High
(High, high)
High Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!
Gun would do the trick, get it over with
You're better off
To take all that you've got and burn it on the spot
Just to get high, (high)

Show me!
What you really want, was it what you got?
Slowly!
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high
Just to get high
Circling the drain, throw it all away
Just to get high Take one of those and two of these
Then watch the walls begin to breathe
I can taste the colour of the lights
Wings are growing out of me
The floor is floating underneath
I can see the future burning bright
Future burning bright The ceiling has us mesmerised
It feels like we could never die
Heading for the dark side of the moon
As we lift off into the sky
Invincible and so alive
Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The universe just started slowing down
Yet suddenly we're travelling A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour When shadows all start breaking free
No longer held by gravity
How did we get so far from the ground?
Speaking to the galaxy
Received and sending back to me
I can finally hear the speed of sound
Speed of fucking sound I like this everlasting pill
'Cause time itself is standing still
Why's the room still spinning just the same?
Turn off your phone so no one calls
'Cause you and I are tripping balls
I can still hear ringing in my brain
Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
See no signs of ever coming down
And suddenly we're travelling A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour Insanity is setting in
Reality is getting thin
The particles are dancing all around
I can't deny the hardest thing for me
Is finding time to finally breathe
See no signs of ever coming down
Another wave is coming in A million miles an hour
A million miles an hour
We're going a million miles an hour
A million miles an hour I wanna do it 'till the sun comes up
Until we're both so good and sweaty
That we can't stand up
I wanna do it 'till we're both about to drop
As long as we're tied up together
Then we're never gonna stop I wanna go until the neighbors all complain
Because they heard somebody screamin'
And they think we're both in pain
I wanna go so long your parents think you've died
There gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI Yeah,
We're gonna love it when the lights go down
Hold on here we go
Yeah,

Round and round we go My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day) Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day Wake up, my baby still look amazing with no make-up

Big Apple is fantastic, but cuts you down to size. They'll treat you like a doormat, expecting you to fail.
Says right across your forehead, integrity for sale. You'll be on TV when it starts to snow in hell.
Bet you wish you heard about it.
Bet you wish you heard about it.
You won't believe me, so go and see it for yourself. From Mexico to New York.
Blondes from California.
East Coast takes the cocaine, West Coast marijuana.
Don't be surprised when you swallow your pride.
It's tough to see through bullshit when it's up above your eyes. Kiss is goodbye, Stealing comes with practice, lying comes with ease.
But neither one is faster then falling to your knees. Money leads to fame and fame is the disease.
The latest epidemic, reality TV. You'll be on TV when it starts to snow in hell.
Bet you wish you heard about it.

Kiss it goodbye. Well, you can dig me up a grave
And try and stick me in the ground
Well, you can tie me to the bed
And try and beat me half to death
But you can never keep me down
Well, you can stick me in a hole
And you can pray all day for rain
You can shoot me in the leg
Just to try to make me beg
And you can leave me there for days And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home, yeah
And I will survive, mmm
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess
You're my California queen
Like the duchess of Detroit
And every city in between
You can slap me in the face
And you can scream profanity
Leave me here to die alone, but
I'll still follow you home
I'll still follow you home You can make a couple calls
And tell your brothers I'm in town
Put a bounty on my head
And tell my parents that I'm dead
And hope to hell I'm never found
You can steal me the keys
To your daddy's Cadillac
You can tamper with the brakes
Call it a mistake
And pray I'm never coming back And I'll stay alive
Just to follow you home, yeah

I'll still follow you home Uncle Sam taught him to shoot
Maybe a little too well
Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet
He hit the stage so full of rage
And let the whole world know it
Six feet away, they heard him say
"Oh God, don't let him pull it." Please, God, don't let him pull it
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched you do it How could you take his life away?
(What made you think you had the right...)
How could you be so full of hate?
(...to take away somebody's life?
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home, and on my own
I cried alone and scratched your name
In the side of a bullet And in the wake of his mistake
So many lives are broken
Gone forever from a loaded bullet
And no excuse that you could use
Could pull somebody through it
And to this day so many say
"God, why'd you let him do it?" How could you let him do it?
How could you put us through it?
His brother watched him do it How could you take his life away?
(What made you think you had the right...)
How could you be so full of hate?
(...to take away somebody's life?
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home, and cried alone
And on my own I scratched your name
In the side of a bullet How could you take his life away?
(What made you think you had the right...)
How could you be so full of hate?
(...to take away somebody's life?
And when I heard you let him die
And made the world all wonder why
I sat at home, and cried alone
And on my own I scratched your name
In the side of a bullet On the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet
On the side of a bullet I judge by what she's wearing
Just how many heads I'm tearing
Off of assholes keep coming on to her
Each night seems like it's getting worse
And I wish she'd take the night off
So I don't have to fight off
Every asshole coming on to her
It happens every night she works
They'll go and ask the DJ
Find out just what would she say
If they all tried coming on to her
Don't they know it's never going to work?
They think they'll get it inside her
With every drink they buy her
As they all try coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt Here comes the next contestant
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant I even fear the ladies
They're cool but twice as crazy
Just as bad for coming on to her
Don't they know it's never gonna work?
Each time she bats an eyelash
Somebody's grabbing her ass
Everyone is coming on to her
This time somebody's getting hurt Here comes the next contestant
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
There goes the next contestant I'm hating what she's wearing
Everybody here keeps staring
Can't wait till they get what they deserve
This time somebody's getting hurt Here comes the next contestant
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?
Is that your hand?
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
I'll watch you leave here limping
I wish you'd do it again
Each night seems like it's getting worse
I wish you'd do it again
This time somebody's getting hurt There goes the next contestant She's got a dirty mouth, it tasted so clean with every taste of me.
You know that every single thing she does.
She does for me, because it's what I'm dreaming of. (You and me, sitting in a tree.
F-U-C-K-I-N-G) And she likes to take her time.
More then fortunate, form of torture.
And she likes to touch and tease.
It's always fun for me, it's always unbelievable. She'll do every naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do.
She's a giver and it gets her off.
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do. If it was on TV, or ever in a magazine.
She could take the fantasy and make it a reality.
She delivers every dirty thought.
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do. And she knows every spot.
Exactly where it's at, and she could draw a map.
But until you have some, it's like a weapon.
And she's always threatening, to be the death of me. (You and me, sitting in a tree.
F-U-C-K-I-N-G) She'll do every naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do.
She's a giver and it gets her off.
My baby, she's into everything I wanna do. If it was on TV, or ever in a magazine.

So, what you wanna do? And me, I'll repay the favor with your favorite thing you love to do. So, what you wanna do?
So, what you wanna do?
I'm about to take it up a notch, so watch what I'm about to do. (You and me, sitting in a tree.
F-U-C-K-I-N-G) She'll do every naughty thing I want
My baby, she's up for anything I wanna do.
She's a giver and it gets her off.

My baby, she's into everything I wanna do. Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want.
Everything I wanna do.
Everything you want, anything at all, everything you want.
Everything I wanna do. This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong who would have guessed it
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late No one will ever see this side reflected
And if there's something wrong who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late The world we knew won't come back
The time we've lost can't get back
The life we had won't be ours again This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late Maybe we'll turn it around 'cause it's not too late
It's never too late
It's not too late, it's never too late I feel it, this tention inside of me
Pressure is presently pushing down on me
The First time,
it starts with just you and I'm
Repeating myself, but you don't hear me I can see what you see
but is it worth it to me?
its the same old conversation
Over and over and over i get sick and tired of
all those lies you tell me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over You seem to say your surprised
I see right trough you this time
But I keep telling you
It's over, it's over, it's over You've taken, these things that belong to me
Twisted so tightly, and sorted so carefully
The last time, the hands were just you and
im Alone in a room with these taunted sheets I can see what you see
And it wanted to me
the same old conversaton
Over and over and over I get sick and tired of
all those lies told me
You say those same things to me
Over and over and over You seem to say your surprised
I see right trough you this time
But I keep telling you
It's over, it's over, it's over you swore, i would regret it
Now thanks to you I can't forget it
'cast all this, 'constint this battle
won't even miss you at all
Free from the slap that you go 2x
I get sick and tired of
all those lies you told me
You say the same things to me
Over and over and over You seem to say your surprised
I see right trough you this time
But I keep telling you It's over, it's over, it's over. I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you
That I've been kissing
Screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back
And we just started getting busy
When she whispered what was that
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are
And that was when she started screamin'
That's my dad outside the car
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while
We were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin' No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals So come on baby, get in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Check out the trouble we're in
We're just a couple of animals
Get in, just get in There's clothes all over the floor
Don't remember them being here before
Smell of perfume is in here, why's lipstick on the mirror
And still I don't understand No pictures left in the hall
There's three new holes in my wall
Where the hell's my credit cards, why's my wallet in the yard
And still I don't understand Well, now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough Should see the look on my face
My shit's all over the place
Why's this happening to me, why'd you take both sets of keys
And still I don't understand Well, now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other
Why's love gotta be so tough Oh, and now I guess I should've listened
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh There's clothes all over my floor
I don't remember them being there before
There are no candles in here, lipstick's still on my mirror
And still I don't understand Oh, and now I guess I should've listened
When you said you'd had enough
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other
Why must love be so tough Well, now I guess I should've listened
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh
When you said you'd had enough
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh
Why's love gotta be so tough Before this hits the ground,
Before this fades away,
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around,
Before I walk away,
I want you to make me
Make me

In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again
Believe again If you could take the dirt
And wash it all away
If you could say the words
That make me want to stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To Hell with all the blame.
If you could take my hand,
If you could lead the way,
I want you to make me,
Make me,

Every time you got onto me
I got caught up
In favorable slavery I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons Well, you know my friends
They know your enemies
And I'd pretend
Not to hear what they said to me
Cause I got off
Every time you got onto me
Was it wrong
To go along with insanity? I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away

I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away

I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons I reside in 209, you're in 208
You moved in last Friday night
And I just couldn't wait
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday
But a lineup formed outside your door
And I was way too late Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with
I want to be that someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath
But I still want to be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I want to be that someone that you're with Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at four AM
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them Well, I'd rather start off slow
This whole thing's like some sort of race
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with
I want to be that someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath
But I still want to be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss
God, I want to be that someone that you're with Well, somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath
But I still want to be that someone that you're with
I've got to be that someone that you're with
And I'm pacing by the phone
'Cause I hate to be alone
And if you're out there with him somewhere, and just about to kiss
God, I've got to be that someone that...
I want to be that someone that...
I've got to be that someone that you're with I'm in a bar full of bikers
And a handful of junkies
It's a fifty fifty chance that they're
Plannin' to jump me
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh Well my favorite little waitress has
Ahold of my eyes
But here's a shotgun
Loaded hidden under the bar
Her finger's on the trigger
If anybody gets out of line There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna like my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go
And I can't get enough of
The things that she does, alright Well, she walks like a model
And she talks like a trucker
Doesn't want a lollipop
But she sure loves a sucker
They' re closin' in around her
I'm cutting to the front of the line
Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila
And a lime for her lips
Laid her body on the bar
And put the salt on her hips
Was lying when I told her
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight There's other places that are better to go
But I'm addicted to the red light show
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole
And I can't get enough of the things that she does She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna lick my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo
And I can't get enough of
The things that she does, alright And I can't get enough of the things that she does
She's gonna be my midnight queen
Locked and loaded
I'm ready to go
She's gonna like my pistol clean
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go She's gonna be my sex machine
And I can never get her under control
She's gonna climb all over me
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo And I can't get enough of
The things that she does, alright
