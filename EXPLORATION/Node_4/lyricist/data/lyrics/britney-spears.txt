Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me Every time I try to fly I fall

I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
It's haunting me
I guess I need you baby I make-believe
That you are here
It's the only way
That I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry At night I pray
That soon your face will fade away Every time I try to fly I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And every time I see
You in my dreams
I see your face
You're haunting me
I guess I need you baby You tell me you're in love with me
Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me
It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close I move away I wanna believe in everything that you say
'Cause it sounds so good
But if you really want me, move slow
There's things about me you just have to know Sometimes I run
Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right, be with you day and night Baby all I need is time I don't wanna be so shy
Every time that I'm alone I wonder why
Hope that you will wait for me
You'll see that you're the only one for me I wanna believe in everything that you say

I, I'm stronger Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out I've been told do what you do with it
We keep both my hands above the blanket
When the light's out Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa I wanna go all the way
Taking out my freak tonight
I wanna show all the dirt
I got running through my mind, whoa Baby, I'm so into you
You've got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is movin', but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before [Chorus]
You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Baby thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin'
My feelins on you
Loving you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before
Chorus
Crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy, but it feels alright
Every day and every night
Chorus Hey, over there
Please, forgive me
If I'm comin' on too strong
Hate to stare
But, you're winnin'
And they're playin' my favorite song
So, come here
A little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear
A little question
Wanna know just how you feel If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? Hey, you might think
That I'm crazy
But, you know I'm just your type
I might be
Little hazy
But, you just cannot deny
There's a spark
In between us
When we're dancin' on the floor
I want more
Wanna see it
So, I'm askin' you tonight If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said I want your body
Would you hold it against me?
Yeah, uh-huh, oh Give me somethin' good
Don't wanna wait
I want it now
Pop it like a hood
And show me how you work it out Alright
If I said my heart was beating loud
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me?
'Cause, you feel like paradise
And I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now
Would you hold it against me? I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always
Go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find
Her way (I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just tryin' to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time) all I need is time
(A moment that is mine) that's mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Not yet a woman
All I need is time (is all I need)
A moment that is mine
While I'm in between I'm not a girl
Oh

All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want (Where you at, Brit?)
We're just so pretty! Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Just you watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!) All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, "hey, baby!"
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change) (The girls roll up)
Windows roll down
(Eyes on us)
Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go)
It's just so funny

We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! If you ask me, I'm killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, enter in line between the beauty and a beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs! All around the world, pretty girls

All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty! Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead, emptiness behind
Where do I go? And you didn't hear
All my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears
Did you now, still I miss you somehow From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Baby, I said
Please stay, give our love a chance for one more day
We could have worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about But you put a dart through my dreams
Through my heart
And I'm back where I started again
Never thought it would end From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love,
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear
Still I wish you were here now From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love
You were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
'Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart Never look back, we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so? For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand?
I'm so glad we're at the same place
At the same time, it's over now
I spotted you dancing
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair
I should shake my thing
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you we're meant to be
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (you know I need you)
Boys, to love her and to hold (I just want you to touch me)
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control Took the boy off the dance floor
Screaming in his ear
Must have said something 'bout me (what you say?)
Because he's looking over here
You looking at me with a sexy attitude
But the way your boys moving it
It puts me in the mood What would it take for you to just leave with me?
Not trying to sound conceited
But me and you were meant to be (don't you know?
You're a sexy guy, I'm a nice girl (don't you know?)
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one (I get nasty)

Boys, then she's in control (You like that? Here we go) Tonight, let's fly, boy have no fear (have no fear)

(You just got to do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected There's a girl in the mirror
I wonder who she is
Sometimes I think I know her
Sometimes I really wish I did There's a story in her eyes
Lullabies and goodbyes
When she's looking back at me
I can tell her heart is broken easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
Something I could do If I could
I would tell her
Not to be afraid
The pain that she's feeling The sense of loneliness will fade
So dry your tears and rest assured
Love will find you like before
When she's looking back at me
I know nothing really works that easily 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying in tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
And I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something
I could do I can't believe it's what I see
That the girl in the mirror
The girl in the mirror
Is me I can't believe what I see (no....)
(The girl in my mirror)
The girl in my mirror is me
Ohh... is me 'Cause the girl in my mirror
Is crying out tonight
And there's nothing I can tell her
To make her feel alright Oh the girl in my mirror
Is crying 'cause of you
I wish there was something
I wish there was something
Oh I wish there was something

Lost in the world out of me myself and I
Was lonely then like an alien
I tried but I never figured it out
Why I always felt like a stranger in a crowd
Ooh that was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone Crossed through the universe to get where you are
Travel the night riding on a shooting star
Was lonely then like an alien
Had to get used to the world I was on
While yet still unsure if I knew where I belong
Ooh That was then like an alien But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone But the stars in the sky look like home, take me home
And the light in your eyes lets me know I'm not alone Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
(Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone
Not alone not alone not alone - not alone not alone not alone) Ya!
Yeah... Aay, shorty.
(Britney giggles) You're so sweet Britney:
Stranger, A stranger
Candy from a stranger Excuse ma, but you're sick
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
Come, be my desert in this
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me; Britney:
I don't even know you But here, I got a snicker for you, here! [Chorus:]
Britney:
What's in front of me?, I just can't believe
Oh, you're tempting me
(Oh oh 'cause you're so sweet)
It's been too long
Oh, it feels so wrong
Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger You don't need to sugar coat it
I got it, and you know it
All of the pieces with it
(mama told me don't) Take candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
Candy from a stranger Shorty, have a bite
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
But, I'll change your life after tonight
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't fight it
Come give it to me [Chorus] [Bridge]
Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Come get some Britney:
A stranger Laze:
Just like that
A stranger
Don't be scared, don't be scared [Bridge x2] Mama use to tell me
Don't take candy from a stranger

You got me reaching with my fingers
She said don't take candy from a stranger,
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger [Chorus x2] Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends
Oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, oh Oops, I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have
Oh, it's beautiful, but wait a minute, isn't this?
Yeah, yes it is
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end
Well baby, I went down and got it for you
Aww, you shouldn't have Oops, I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops, you think that I'm sent from above

Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love

I'm not that innocent Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do
Baby, you spin me around
Oh, the earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground Every time you look at me
My heart is jumpin', it's easy to see
Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Oh oh
Tell me, you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me, I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wastin' my feelings on you Lovin' you means so much more
More than anything I ever felt before You drive me crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Crazy
I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Crazy
But it feels alright
Every day and every night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night You drive me crazy (you drive me crazy, baby)
Yeah
Oh crazy (you make me feel alright)
But it feels alright
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night
Baby, thinkin' of you keeps me up all night Nothing about you is typical
Nothing about you is predictable
You've got me all twisted and confused
(It's all new)
Up til now, I thought I knew love
Nothing to loose and its damaged cause
Patterns will fall as quick as I do, but now Bridges are burning
Baby I'm learning, a new way of thinking now
Love I can see, nothing will be, just like it was
Is that because? Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring trying to defend myself
In the private eye to see what's going on
(That's long gone)
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you said you will be
Shocking cause I never knew love like this could exist Tables are turning
My heart is soaring, You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all
Never met anyone like you Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you call my name
Now everything has changed Baby you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to, break my heart?
I expect you do, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human cause
Only an angel can be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual You Said you're gonna be here in a minute
Sitting in the mirror, getting pretty
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
Gotta look my best if we gonna break up
I can hear you knocking at the front door
And I know exactly what you came for
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy
Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy You
Touch me and it's breaking me down
And me down, and me down, and me down
I'm telling you, let's just give it up
And get down, and get down, and get down So come on
Won't you give me something to remember?
Baby, shut your mouth and turn me inside out

How you shook my world and flipped it upside down
You're the only one who ever drove me crazy
'Cause you know me inside out
Inside out I know that we probably shouldn't do this
Wake up in the morning feeling stupid
Said that we were done but you're all up on me
Said that we were done but you're all up on me

Guess I gotta get you out my system
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy
Trying to let you go but it's not that easy You

All these years weve been
Weve been hurting
We have to look inside
And try
To let go You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go French fingertips,
Red lips
Bitch is dangerous
Cotton candy kiss
Can't wait for my sugar rush Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feeling's so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Alright, let's go! Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Heels 6 inch
Makes a boy wanna bite his lip
Look but don't touch
Unless you want to lose your innocence Can't take it no more
I got to have more tonight
This feelings so strong
I'm putting you on tonight Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Baby take a seat
Eyes on me this is my show
Your one and only pleasure
All decked in lace and leather
Fantasy, courtesy of me
Baby let's go
Watch me apply the pressure
All decked in lace and leather Breathe you out
Breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could have been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away but it never disappears
I try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) So let me go
Just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growing deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) And part of me still believes
When you say you're gonna stick around
And part of me still believes
We can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye
Forever I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) I don't wanna dream about
All the things that never were
Maybe I can live without
When I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain
What good would it do me now
I'll get it all figured out
When I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under) From under, from under, from under, from under. I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
I'm going to places I can be out of control And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly I love myself
It's not a sin
I can't control what's happenin' 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately I've been noticin' the beautiful me
I'm all in my skin and I'm not gonna wait
I'm into myself in the most precious way And I don't want to explain tonight
All the things I've tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and I'll teach myself to fly 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand There's a world undefined
And my body is mine
I won't be left behind
I'm already here 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand 'Cause I just discovered
Imagination's taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand Do you feel this
I know you feel this
Are you ready?
I don't think so Somebody give me my truck
So I can ride on the clouds
So I can turn up the bass like Somebody pass my guitar
So I can look like a star
And spend this cash like What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me
Like I'm some kind of freak
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'? I see you lookin' at me
Like I got what you need
Get up out of your seat
Why don't you do somethin'? Now you're all in my grill
'Cause I say what I feel
Only rocks on what's real
Baby bump bump
But I can't do that with you
Only here with my crew
I can roll if you can
Don't be a punk punk What'chu gonna do when the crowd goes a-yo?
Why you standin' on the wall?
Music startin' everywhere
So why don't you just move along? I see you lookin' at me

Britney (break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
Oh, toy soldier
Oh, toy soldier
Oh, toy soldier I'm out the door, it's automatic, simple babe
I'm like a fire, bottle busting in your face
So tired of you being up in my space
How much more could I take?
I'm tired of privates driving, need a general that ain't weak When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew the type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good, doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
Won't be just coming over I don't want no more (break me off)
Oh, toy soldier
I'm simply sick and tired of those
Oh, toy soldier
I don't want no more
Oh, toy soldier
I'm simply sick and tired of those I want it more than ever now
I realized that they ain't listening
Like a princess supposed to get it
That's why I'm dusting off my fitted
Coming back looking delicious
Yes I know they want to kiss me
Now I hold them at attention
Cause new Britney's on a mission When I shut the door, leaving with my bag
Hit the scene in my new wagon
Bet he gonna wish he knew the type of fun I'm getting into
Peek-a-boo, he good, doing things you wish you could
He's not talking, he's just walking
Like them city boys from New York This time I need a soldier, a really bad ass soldier
That know how to take, take care of me
I'm so damn glad that's over
This time I need a soldier, I'm sick of toy soldiers
A boy that knows how to take care of me
