Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh If I can see it hoo, then I can be it

I believe I can touch the sky

I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh, I believe I can fly hoo Hey, 'cause I believe in me, oh If I can see it hoo, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it hey I believe I can fly hoo

"I just really feel that we are going to be known as the school that overcame" I know you're feeling pain right now
And you don't wanna talk right now
I know you're going through something
And you don't wanna be bothered right now
Not gonna lie and say I understand
I just wanna be here for you if I can
To hold your hand and be by your side
And together we will get through these times [Bridge:]
And we will cry together
And we'll fight this together
And we'll be strong together
Stand together, pray together [Chorus:]
Rise up, when you feel you can't go on
Rise up, when all of your hope is gone
Rise up, when you're weak and you can't be strong
Rise, rise up
Rise up, and when the tears start to fall
Rise up, and you feel you've given it your all
Rise up, when your back is up against the wall
Rise, rise up Now I know the burdens that you've had
And you don't think nobody cares
A storm comes out of nowhere
And you're feeling like it just ain't fair
Not here to preach about the private side, no
'Cause I understand and now is not the time
See I just wanna help you make it right
Walk with you, holding the candle light [Bridge] [Chorus] You see struggle so hard
No color, no color
And you missed the price
You are my sister
I'm your brother
And side by side we'll face this thing
Standing tall, you and me Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise Hey we gon' rise Rise up, rise
Rise up, rise [Chorus x3] This is a stroy about a man comin' in

And I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound
Somethings goin' on upstairs, yeah

As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear
And then I hear my Baby's voice, in my ear
Screamin' out You're contagious, touch me, baby

Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild
And I just can't believe this shit I ran downstairs lookin' the closet lookin' for that who
Said a prayer 'cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin' now in my own damn house
Who would have thought she was creepin' with another man
The down low happened to me all over again And then I turned the TV down
'Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound
Somethin' goin' on upstairs, yeah
'Cause I know that no one else lives here Bomp, bomp, bomp
As I get closer to the stair ways, all I hear

Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light
And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky
Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Won't you come and set me free
Won't you set me free The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Won't you come and set me free, yeah yeah
Won't you come and set me free, hey (It's like) It's like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Somewhere beyond the clouds

Down on me, looks like, I can see the light, shinin'!
Fear is going, the world's turnin'
The clouds movin, the sun shinin'
(If that guy can see the light, shine it!)
The rain is gone, I made it home
Rainbow, pot of gold (The storm is over now)

I can feel Heaven over me, yeah
(Heaven is over me) Come and set me free

(Can you feel it?)Believe in a pot of gold
(He's the greatest)At the end of a rainbow How did I ever let you slip away
Never knowing I'd be singing this song some day
And now I'm sinking, sinking to rise no more
Ever since you closed the door If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine Funny, funny how time goes by
And blessings are missed in the wink of an eye
Why oh why oh why should one have to go on suffering
When every day I pray please come back to me If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then my darlin' you'd still be mine
If I could turn, turn back the hands of time
Then darlin' you, you'd still be mine And you had enough love for the both of us
But I, I, I did you wrong, I admit I did
But now I'm facing the rest of my life alone, whoa If I could turn, turn back the hands of time

(Oh, I believe) I wish, I wish, I wish
To every city
I wish, I wish, I wish
Every hood
I wish, I wish, I wish
And every block
Ghetto America! Rollin' through the hood
Just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know
Your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed
Going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days
You used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessey
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be
To get up out this hood was like a fantasy And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Now ever since this money come
It's been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish that I could just trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin', this real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't want to raise the roof
Until my shit is going down And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
(With you)
And how I used to club hop on weekends
(With you)
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolences I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Said the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men? And now you hear my songs the radio is bangin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
Boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride (With you)
How I used to street perform on Friday
(With you)
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
(With you)
Standing here throwing them songs at me
Somebody pray for me I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okay I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face

All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me

And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]

Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell, the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah (ooh, yeah)
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too, too many times
Now I can't come around 'Cause when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's just like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Oh yeah, oh yeah, la la da da
La
La da da da da
La da da da da
La
Oh yeah, la da da da da
La
Oh, ah, listen, if you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays When a woman's fed up
Mama taught me along time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it (nothing you can do about it)
Oh no, it's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
Then it's too late to talk about it (too late to talk about it) Yeah
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
Said I miss you baby, whoa, whoa, oh yeah When a woman loves
She, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She took me back
After I broke her heart
About a thousand times
She gave her life to me
With no regrets, she followed me
And she, and she, the girl she raised me
And I'm forever indebted, and I'm forever indebted,
I'm forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real She filled my soul
With the very touch of her hand
She really did
And she's got more, more faith in me than a beach got sand
And I like to tell her, I like to tell her, that I'm forever indebted,
That I'm forever indebted, forever indebted to her cause When a woman loves
She, she, she loves for real
Yea, yea See a woman love
It would never die young
Even when I'm dead and gone,
I'm gonna love her from the sky, yea
'Cause she's given me
Something that no other woman has given me (Whoo)
When I think about you girl it makes me sink When, when, when, when,
When a, when a woman
Loves
She loves for real (oh)
When a woman loves, loves, loves

BARACK OBAMA:
In small towns and big cities
We came together
As democrats, republicans, and independents
To stand up and say that we are
ONE NATION, we are ONE PEOPLE
And our time for changed has COME.. R. KELLY:
When the mountain seems too high
And you don't have the courage nor the strength to climb
And the road you're on won't end
But still you run though you cannot see the finish line And dark clouds are over you
Your skies no longer blue
But you marched on straight ahead
Somehow you made it through Got to the mountain peek
They left a path of me
Your victory made history and now CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I When it felt like you were weak
And couldn't fight no more
On the ropes and it seemed like
You was gonna run out of breathe When the world was on your shoulder
And the walls were in your way
You leaped and made it over
Through it all you kept the faith With hope you set us free
You showed us how to dream
And now we can lift our voices
And forever sing Now the time to look ahead
And thank our heroes of the past
And celebrate this victory
Let's raise the flag cause CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I BRIDGE:
And when they tried to keep you down
You kept up your head
Never losing sight
You believed in what was right You endured to the end
Walked through the strongest wind
The storms over
And a new day begins And when our hope was dying
You brought us healing
And now I got something
To tell my children CHORUS:
I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, I believe, I believe
Oh I Baby you are the song of my life
And the sweetest melody
And I love making love to your eyes
It's like singing in the perfect key You are my number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
My number one hit
You are my number one hit
My number one hit

Searching for that open door, door Every road that I've taken
Lead to my regret.

And the rays from the sun wakes me
I'm stretchin' and yawnin'
In a bed that don't belong to me
And a voice yells, "Good morning, darlin", from the bathroom
Then she comes out and kisses me
And to my surprise, she ain't you Now I've got this dumb look on my face
Like, what have I done?
How could I be so stupid to be have laid here til the morning sun?
Lost the track of time
Oh, what was on my mind?
From the club, went to her home
Didn't plan to stay that long Here I am, quickly tryin' to put on my clothes
Searching for my car keys
Tryin' to get on up out the door
Then she stretched her hands in front of it
Said, "You can't go this way"
Looked at her, like she was crazy
Said, "Woman move out my way"
Said, "I got a wife at home"
She said, "Please don't go out there"
"Lady, I've got to get home"
She said, her husband was comin' up the stairs "Shh, shh, quiet
Hurry up and get in the closet"
She said, "Don't you make a sound
Or some shit is going down"
I said, "Why don't I just go out the window?"
"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor"
"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet"
And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin' to figure out
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house Then he walks in and yells, "I'm home"
She says, "Honey, I'm in the room"
Walks in there with a smile on his face
Sayin', "Honey, I've been missin' you"
She hops all over him
And says, "I've cooked and ran your bath water?
I'm tellin' you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar Throws her in the bed
And start to snatchin' her clothes off
I'm in the closet, like man, what the fuck is going on?
You're not gonna believe it
But things get deeper as the story goes on
Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone
I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate
But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late
He hopped up and said, "There's a mystery going on
And I'm gonna solve it"
And I'm like, "God please, don't let this man open this closet? He walks in the bathroom
And looks behind the door
She says, "Baby, come back to bed"
He says, "Bitch say no more"
He pulls back the shower curtain
While she's biting her nails
Then he walks back to the room
Right now, I'm sweating like hell
Checks under the bed
Then under the dresser
He looks at the closet
I pull out my Beretta
He walks up to the closet
He goes up to the closet
Now he's at the closet
Damn he's opening the closet? i need an angel i'm calling an angel send me an angel now Had the landlord at my door
I heard him saying,
Tomorrow no more
Pay me now or leave
But we didn't have anything to give(ah can you feel me) Searching for restoration(and we need restoration)
Make the church my family
This is my story
This is my song
And I can sing it all night long I tell you why because, [Chorus] The ghetto is a part of my religion(the only thing my eyes can see)
The only thing my eyes can see(and I tell you there ain't no man)
There ain't no man gonna stop the vision(I'm a part of the ghetto)
The ghetto is a part of me Children cry no more(children cry no more)
Because heaven is upon you
Please put down your guns
And we shall overcome Thought your load may be heavy
Know that the weight makes you strong
Take my life for example
While I sing my song
Mr. Kelly help me sing this song [Chorus X2] La la la la la lala la..X3 (fade out)
The ghetto is a part of me
The ghetto is a part of my religion [Celine Dion]
No mountain's too high for you to climb
All you have to do is have some climbing faith
No river's too wide for you to make it across
All you have to do is believe it when you pray [R Kelly]
And then you will see the morning will come
and everyday will be bright as the sun
All of your fears cast them on me
I just want you to see [Chorus: Celine Dion & R. Kelly]
I'll be your cloud up in the sky
I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me
I am your Angel,
And when all hope is gone, I'm here
No matter how far you are, I'm near
It makes no difference who you are
I am your Angel, I'm your Angel [R Kelly]
I saw your tear drops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way
Let me show you a better day [Celine Dion]
And then you will see, the morning will come
And all of your days will be bright as the sun
So all of your fears just cast them on me
How can I make you see [Chorus] [R Kelly]
And when it's time to face the storm [Celine Dion]
I'll be right by your side [R Kelly]
Grace will keep us safe and warm
And I know we will survive [Celine Dion]
And when it seems as if your end is drawing near (end is drawing near)
Don't you dare give up the fight
Just put your trust beyond the skies [Chorus: Repeats] [Chorus]
This is my song for real no doubt
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to dance floor
We begin to dance slow

Been watched on these blocks Yeah you know I walk
Through the valley of these blocks

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up) Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up) All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up) Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up

This is my prayer, baby, baby, baby, I love you I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out

Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
Heard a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free, whoa Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone
Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone
And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind
I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (mountains)
I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind
And then a small voice sayin' The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)
Come on and set me free Somehow my beginning stepped right in (right in)
Then faith became my friend (my friend)
And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind
When it's sayin' (sayin') The storm is over
(The storm is over now)
And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)
I can feel Heaven, yeah

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday (woo, shake!) I was riding in my car one day
In the express lane rollin on the freeway
And suddenly the phone rings then I
Reached down beside me then i look
On the floor felt on the backseat
See I was drinking while I was driving
Never thinking bout what I was doing
I turned around and before i knew it
Here comes this truck now Doctor said don't think he gonna make it
Family said make the funeral arrangements
Unplug the machine he's gone now
Then told my wife to be strong now
Then a small voice said told me
If you promise to stop drinking
I surrendered on that day
Now for ten years i've been straight You saved me [4x]
Gave me a second chance
You saved me [3x]
You saved me Now i've been sitting in this chair
Waiting on the phone to ring
Praying up to God that someone will call
Me with a job opening
Cause it's been so hard for me
Month to month struggling to eat
But still there was no answer
I stop believing in his word and
Got so mad at him and
When somebody said God's good
I just laugh at 'em But in the nick of time his blessing
Rain on me
By his grace the phone ring
A lady said were hiring and
That's when I knew You saved me [4x] Now i was 18 out there on the block
Selling drugs
With a gun at my waist
And for people I had no love
See the streets was my home
Family and friends were all gone
Had no one to trust
And deep inside i was all alone
And a deal went bad one day
And it was enough to pause me
I was shot 4 times and before i
Knew it I was on my knees Blood pushin out my body
My heart's beating faster don't know what i'm gonna do
I don't think i'm gonna last then
I begain to flash back on the things
I done in my past
Then I heard a small voice that said
I'll give you peace if you believe
I accepted Christ that day
Halilujah now i'm free You saved me [4x] I was in the aisle of the grocery store
With a pain in my chest and I'm wondering
Where did it come from (I got tested)
And the results came back
And the doctor said i'm sorry but u got cancer
I could not beleive it so
I call my mama to calm my nerves (mama) she got down on her knees
(mama) she said a prayer for me
(mama) just keep on thanking Jesus
(mama) he'll give you what you need
(thank you Jesus)
Now that was five years ago
I don't have that pain no more
Doc said you can go home
Cause all your cancer's gone You saved me [4x] You saved me (said you saved me)
You saved me (but you saved me)
You saved me saaaved me
Gave me a second chance (second chance)
Halilujah saved me
Saved me saved me
Wooooooh You saved me You gave me it was by grace You saved me
I'm so thankful that You looked down on me
Saw me standing there
I was at the end of my rope no where to go
And you gave me No where to go (and you saved me)
I was down and out 2
I was doing drugs 2
I was running the streets 2
Never felt love
I was wilding out
You saved me
You stepped in ooh save me You saved me You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is You remind me of my jeep, I want to ride it
Something like my sound, I want to pump it
Girl you look just like my cars, I want to wax it

Baby, you know I want you real bad

Gotham city for the ghetto ghetto Uh yo yo! Everybody's talking
About the good old days
About the good old days
Huh I remember when me and my brothers
We used to sit up on the porch in the
Summertime and just talk about just making it
You know what I'm saying being successful
Following up our dreams you know and I
I believe that's every kids dream
You know what I'm saying to rise and
Be somebody but damn!
Sometimes we just get caught up I ain't got no money
And I ain't got no friends
Looks like my world is coming to an end
No food on the table, no clothes on my back
No shoes on my feet and
I just bearly got a used Cadillac
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah
Ghetto for ya
So I took this remix and
Rearranged gotham city [Chorus]
City of love a city of peace
For everyone of us
'Cause we all need it,
Can't live without it
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah! Gotham city for the ghetto,
That's what I'm talking 'bout
Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous
If you wanna test raffishness for the respect
S.T.R.I.N.G.S. Yes. (oh yeah)
Fuck the rest give me the best
Why should I have to settle for less
When I could push the V-12's with finesse
(scratching) and all that mess
If you try to hold me back
Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky.
Even if you wanted to you can't deny
Gotta feed baby girl who would die We keep talking about escalating
Well who's gonna go first
Guess I'll be the one to step up
If you don't follow me it would be the worst
Every time something goes down
Somebody's crying ghetto tears
Hope I'm not raining on your parade
But this is not what keeping it really is
Now ain't that ghetto for ya
But somehow it's gotta change yeah!
Ghetto for ya,
So I took this remix and rearranged
A gotham city [Chorus] Check it out
Now motherfucker wanna act surprised
'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise
That's why you ass get left behind
They got a sight, they got a mind
'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream
Talk that shit, block my cream
Negativity you gotta let go
Heaven gotta see for the ghetto We all need hey hey hey
Gotham city for the ghetto yeah
Calling on heaven
Send your love down, to the ghetto yeah

Prayer changes (I heard that)
Prayer changes (I believe that)
Prayer changes (I know that)
Prayer changes things Now I was in a real bad abusive relationship
Knowing that, that was no way for me to live
A young girl like me, raised up in a good family
Way too young to endure such misery
And every night I cry myself to sleep from all the pain
And the more I prayed for sunny days it seemed to rain
(He hit me) at any given time
(He hit me) no reason at all
(He hit me) so so hard
(He hit me) my God, sometimes I'd fall
Mama asked what happened to me
And I'd take up for him
She said that devil's a liar
And pray get rid of him
And now I'm going to school, hitting those books
I'm doing fine
He's out my life, I'm not confused
Got peace of mind, man I tell you Prayer changes (it changes)

Prayer changes things I was a freshman in college and uh
I had just made it on the basketball team
I had all the skills it took to make it
But on my grades I would get nothing but all D's
And the coach came to me and had a talk with me about my career
Said if you don't get your grades up
I'm gonna have to sit you down this year
Man as tough as I was I brake down and cry 'cause
Everybody knows me, knows that basketball is my life
(Algebra) I studied hard
(Chemistry) I gave my all
(Calculus) oh my God
(English) so many flaws
Playing ball didn't look to good for me
My future, could not see
I had lost all my beliefs
And gave up on all my dreams
Then I went to church on Sunday
And the pastor began to preach
It was like he was talking to me
When he said I can do all things
In Christ that strengthens me
And for me that was enough
Now that I went from a D all the way to an A plus
I tell you prayer changes things Prayer changes

We thought that nothing could solve them
Listening to family members and so called friends
Man I tell you that's just how the devil creeps in (oh yes it is)
We were separated at least for a month or two
She was wilding in the clubs
And I was out there doing wrong too
And we would walk around the house
Putting each other down
I mean right in front of the kids
We would curse each other out
Then I was in a bad accident
And almost lost my life
And guess who was there for me
My wife
Now ain't it funny how He makes a way
When we said there was no way
I'm out the hospital and back at home

But that's okay, 'cause there's nothing God can't achieve
I don't care what the problem in your life may be
'Cause who the Son sets free, is free indeed
And if you didn't know, now you should know
All you gotta do is take this family's life for example
Now Mom and Dad are married again
Four kids now, 'cause they just had twins
Little sister all grown up now
She's a lawyer, married with one child now
Two years, big brother's out of college

Every since you left your baby, boy's been dealin' with
Problem after problem, tell me what am I supposed to do
See, I get lost sometimes, don't understand this place
Look in the mirror sometimes and see a troubled face
And then my tears roll down and hit the sink
Then I hold my head up high, I hope the Man upstairs can hear my cry
All these questions deep inside my mind
Like if Jesus loved me, why he leave my side, mama
I'm still tryin' to get the answer why
You were young, 45, and you had to die
I'm always tryin' to help people out
And it's them same people tryin' to take food out my mouth (Fo' real tho') It seems like the more money I make
(Fo' real tho') The more drama y'all try to create
(Fo' real tho') And through I try to move into the positive
(Fo' real tho') The more y'all don't want to let me live When will you realize that I don't owe you nothin'
Need to get up off your butt and go get your own somethin'
I'm pullin' on my hair to keep from snappin' off
Fools ride up in my camp and be actin' off
Somebody out there please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me, wet me with your love
I need you to take me and lift me up, oh, yeah I gave 13 years of my life to this industry
Hit song or not, I've given all of me
You smile in my face and tell me that you love
But then before you know the truth, you're so quick to judge me
That's alright, go ahead, keep talkin'
'Cause I'ma hold my head up high and keep walkin'
And reach for the sky, focus on the plan
Rescue the kid with his paper a pen
And this is for the homies that we lost
Yo', we cannot forget y'all, so the hats come off
We pour a little liquor out for the memory
I know y'all up there sittin' on chrome in them pearly streets
The street survivors before careful, stay alive
I'm prayin' for your families, I hope you pray for mine (Fo' real tho') Used to be a time you wished me well
(Fo' real tho') It hurts to know you want to see me fail
(Fo' real tho') And don't forget I kept you out of jail
(Fo' real tho') Where's my arms when you needed to be held They turn they backs on you, who was there believin'
Who said your troubles were only for a season
In church together tryin' to pick up all the pieces
And now you betray me, I bind you in the name of Jesus
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
Still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
(Please shower down)
So shower down on me, wet me with your love (Yeah)
I need you to take me and lift me up (Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) Man, I tell you it's enough to make you want to give it up
Thank God for my fans 'cause through it all they show me love
To my sister and to brothers
Tell me why can't we just try to get along with one another
And stop hurtin' one another, fightin' one another
Man, I pray to God He get my family back together
Let me see what want to see, just to blind me
All of these luxuries, wine and dining
And then You push me out in front to get behind me
Then You sat me up by blessin' me to bind me
I'm a grown man with kids now, stakes are high
Gotta go to church now to avoid the fight
Frankly, y'all to keep it real I'm just tired
Have dreams of bein' dead, but the devil is alive (Fo' real tho') Church folks, you need to stop judgin'
(Fo' real tho') Or you will be the first to be judged
(Fo' real tho') And women stop dependin' on us men
(Fo' real tho') And start dependin' on the Man above, feel me And as for robbin', here's what I need to do
Get rid of them clowns and get myself a whole 'nother crew
Media, do your job
But please just don't make my job so hard
Somebody please pray what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm still young tryin' to figure it all out Heaven, I need a hug
Is there anybody out there willin' to embrace a thug
Feelin' like a change of heart
And all I really need is a sign or a word from God
So shower down on me (Shower down on me now), wet me with your love
I need you to take me (Please) and lift me up, yeah,

Oh like lost inside of a mascaraed
Oh like a celebration in a big parade
Oh like a secret told to the one you trust
Oh like kissing you in a all white tux You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know)

And just like the ocean when the well comes high,
Like an eagle when it soars in the sky Out of all the girls I've loved before
Out of all the stages I've performed on
Out of all of the cities I've been to
I bless the day that I found you I bless the day I found you and that's my word
It's nothing for me out there in those streets
You took my heart and you set it on fire
And now my love forever burns
You keep taking me higher [Chorus]
I been looking for love
In all the wrong places
And now I finally found
Someone who cares for me
No matter the storm
It was you who helped me face it
And now it's safe to say
That you really care for me Just like the wings
You took me, flew me away, yeah
And now my ground is underneath my feet
This man had nowhere to go
Then you gave me direction
And now the rest of my days
I can't help but give you the praise [Chorus] You saw my needs, forgave my faults
You cleansed my heart, you changed my thoughts
You brought the sun into my life
When my world had seemed dark, yes you did
And you're the only one
