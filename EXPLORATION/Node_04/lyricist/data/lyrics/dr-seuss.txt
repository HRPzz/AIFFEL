The Cat in the Hat
By Dr. Seuss
The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house
All that cold cold wet day.
I sat there with Sally.
We sat there we two.
And I said How I wish
We had something to do!
Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.
So all we could do was to
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
Sit!
And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.
BUMP!
And then
something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!
We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us
Why do you sit there like that?
I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!
I know some good games we could play
Said the cat.
I know some new tricks
Said the Cat in the Hat.
A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do.
Then Sally and I
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.
But our fish said No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat
You do NOT want to play.
He should not be here.
He should not be about.
He should not be here
When your mother is out!
Now! Now! Have no fear.
Have no fear! said the cat.
My tricks are not bad
Said the Cat in the Hat.
Why we can have
Lots of good fun if you wish
with a game that I call
UP UP UP with a fish!
Put me down! said the fish.
This is no fun at all!
Put me down! said the fish.
I do NOT wish to fall!
Have no fear! said the cat.
I will not let you fall.
I will hold you up high
As I stand on a ball.
With a book on one hand!
And a cup on my hat!
But that is not ALL I can do!
Said the cat
Look at me!
Look at me now! said the cat.
With a cup and a cake
On the top of my hat!
I can hold up TWO books!
I can hold up the fish!
And a litte toy ship!
And some milk on a dish!
And look!
I can hop up and down on the ball!
But that is not all!
Oh no.
That is not all
Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have to know how.
I can hold up the cup
And the milk and the cake!
I can hold up these books!
And the fish on a rake!
I can hold the toy ship
And a little toy man!
And look! With my tail
I can hold a red fan!
I can fan with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh no.
That is not all.
That is what the cat said
Then he fell on his head!
He came down with a bump
From up there on the ball.
And Sally and I
We saw ALL the things fall!
And our fish came down too.
He fell into a pot!
He said Do I like this?
Oh no! I do not.
This is not a good game
Said our fish as he lit.
No I do not like it
Not one little bit!
Now look what you did!
Said the fish to the cat.
Now look at this house!
Look at this! Look at that!
You sank our toy ship
Sank it deep in the cake.
You shook up our house
And you bent our new rake.
You SHOULD NOT be here
When our mother is not.
You get out of this house!
Said the fish in the pot.
But I like to be here.
Oh I like it a lot!
Said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to go!
And so said the Cat in the Hat
So
so
so
I will show you
Another good game that I know!
And then he ran out.
And then fast as a fox
The Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a box.
A big red wood box.
It was shut with a hook.
Now look at this trick
Said the cat.
Take a look!
Then he got up on top
With a tip of his hat.
I call this game FUN IN A BOX
Said the cat.
In this box are two things
I will show to you now.
You will like these two things
Said the cat with a bow.
I will pick up the hook.
You will see something new.
Two things. And I call them
Thing One and Thing Two.
These Things will not bite you.
They want to have fun.
Then out of the box
Came Thing Two and Thing One!
And they ran to us fast.
They said How do you do?
Would you like to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two?
And Sally and I
Did not know what to do.
So we had to shake hands
With Thing One and Thing Two.
We shook their two hands.
But our fish said No! No!
Those Things should not be
In this house! Make them go!
They should not be here
When your mother is not!
Put them out! Put them out!
Said the fish in the pot.
Have no fear little fish
Said the Cat in the Hat.
These Things are good Things.
And he gave them a pat.
They are tame. Oh so tame!
They have come here to play.
They will give you some fun
On this wet wet wet day.
Now here is a game that they like
Said the cat.
They like to fly kites
Said the Cat in the Hat
No! Not in the house!
Said the fish in the pot.
They should not fly kites
In a house! They should not.
Oh the things they will bump!
Oh the things they will hit!
Oh I do not like it!
Not one little bit! Then Sally and I
Saw them run down the hall.
We saw those two Things
Bump their kites on the wall!
Bump! Thump! Thump! Bump!
Down the wall in the hall.
Thing Two and Thing One!
They ran up! They ran down!
On the string of one kite
We saw Mothers new gown!
Her gown with the dots
That are pink white and red.
Then we saw one kite bump
On the head of her bed!
Then those Things ran about
With big bumps jumps and kicks
And with hops and big thumps
And all kinds of bad tricks.
And I said
I do NOT like the way that they play
If Mother could see this
Oh what would she say!
Then our fish said Look! Look!
And our fish shook with fear.
Your mother is on her way home!
Do you hear?
Oh what will she do to us?
What will she say?
Oh she will not like it
To find us this way!
So DO something! Fast! said the fish.
Do you hear!
I saw her. Your mother!
Your mother is near!
So as fast as you can
Think of something to do!
You will have to get rid of
Thing One and Thing Two!
So as fast as I could
I went after my net.
And I said With my net
I can get them I bet.
I bet with my net
I can get those Things yet!
Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Thoe two Things had to stop.
Then I said to the cat
Now you do as I say.
You pack up those Things
And you take them away!
Oh dear! said the cat
You did not like our game
Oh dear.
What a shame!
What a shame!
What a shame!
Then he shut up the Things
In the box with the hook.
And the cat went away
With a sad kind of look.
That is good said the fish.
He has gone away. Yes.
But your mother will come.
She will find this big mess!
And this mess is so big
And so deep and so tall
We ca not pick it up.
There is no way at all!
And THEN!
Who was back in the house?
Why the cat!
Have no fear of this mess
Said the Cat in the Hat.
I always pick up all my playthings
And so
I will show you another
Good trick that I know!
Then we saw him pick up
All the things that were down.
He picked up the cake
And the rake and the gown
And the milk and the strings
And the books and the dish
And the fan and the cup
And the ship and the fish.
And he put them away.
Then he said That is that.
And then he was gone
With a tip of his hat.
Then our mother came in
And she said to us two
Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?
And Sally and I did not know
What to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on there that day?
Should we tell her about it?
Now what SHOULD we do?
Well
What would YOU do
If your mother asked YOU?

How The Grinch Stole Christmas
by Dr. Suess
Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot
But the GrinchWho lived just north of Whoville Did NOT!
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now please dont ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be his head wasnt screwed on just right.
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Whatever the reason His heart or his shoes
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos
Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath
Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath.
And theyre hanging their stockings! he snarled with a sneer
Tomorrow is Christmas! Its practically here!
Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming
I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!
For Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys
Would wake bright and early. Theyd rush for their toys!
And then! Oh the noise! Oh the Noise!
Noise! Noise! Noise!
Thats one thing he hated! The NOISE!
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!
Then the Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.
And theyd feast! And theyd feast! And theyd FEAST!
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
They would feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast.
Which was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least!
And THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all!
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small
Would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.
Theyd stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing!
Theyd sing! And theyd sing! And theyd SING!
SING! SING! SING!
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing
The more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing!
Why for fifty three years Ive put up with it now!
I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA!
I know just what to do! The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick!
With this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick!
All I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around.
But since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found.
Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said
If I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead!
So he called his dog Max. Then he took some red thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.
Then the Grinch said Giddap! And the sleigh started down
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.
When he came to the first little house on the square.
This is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed
And he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist.
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch.
He got stuck only once for a moment or two.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
These stockings he grinned are the first things to go!
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room and he took every present!
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch very nimbly
Stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney!
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos feast!
He took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash!
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
And NOW! grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree!
And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
He turned around fast and he saw a small Who!
Little Cindy Lou Who who was not more than two.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter
Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why????????????
Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?
But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick
He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!
Why my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied
Theres a light on this tree that wont light on one side.
So Im taking it home to my workshop my dear.
Ill fix it up there. Then Ill bring it back here.
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!
Then he went up the chimney himself the old liar.
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food That he left in the house
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos houses
Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses!
It was quarter past dawn All the Whos still a bed
All the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!
PoohPooh to the Whos! he was grinchishly humming.
Theyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming!
Theyre just waking up! I know just what theyll do!
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!
Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear!
So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low. Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasnt sad! Why this sound sounded merry!
It couldnt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small
Was singing! Without any presents at all!
He HADNT stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!
Somehow or other it came just the same!
And the Grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow
Stood puzzling and puzzling: How could it be so?
It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!
It came without packages boxes or bags!
And he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before!
Maybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store.
Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more!
And what happened then? Wellin Whoville they say
That the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day!
And the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!
And he HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!

We like our Mike and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high.
Hello there Ned. How do you do?
Tell me tell me what is new?
How are things in your little bed?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
I do not like this bed at all.
a lot of things have come to call.
A cow a dog a cat a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!
Oh dear oh dear! I cannot hear.
Will you please come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there I fear.
Say look! A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear my dear.
My hat is old my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off my foot is cold.
My shoe is off my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old my teeth are gold.
And now my story is all told.
We took a look. We saw a Nook.
On his head he had a hook.
On his hook he had a book.
On his book was How to Cook
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook cant read so a Nook cant Cook.
SO
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?
the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
by the light of the moon by the light of a star;
They walked all night from near to far.
I would never walk. I would take a car.
I do not like this one so well.
all he does is yell yell yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in I put him out.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him in the house.
At our house we open cans.
We have to open many cans.
and that is why we have a Zans.
A Zans for cans is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans? You should.
I like to box. How I like to box.
So every day I box a Gox.
In yellow socks I box my Gox.
I box in yellow Gox box socks.
It is fun to sing if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing like anything.
I sing high and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad you know.
this one I think is called a Yink.
he likes to wink he likes to drink.
He likes to drink and drink and drink.
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.
SO
If you have a lot of ink
you should get a Yink I think.
Hop hop hop! I am a Yop
All I like to do is hop
From finger top to finger top.
I hop from left to right and then
Hop hop! I hop right back again.
I like to hop all day and night.
From right to left and left to right.
Why do I like to hop hop hop?
I do not know. Go ask your Pop.
Brush brush brush brush
Comb comb comb comb
Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.
All girls who like to brush and comb
Should have a pet like this at home.
Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
You never yet met a pet I bet
As wet as they let this wet pet get.
Did you ever fly a kite in bed?
did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?
Did you ever milk this kind of cow?
Well we can do it. We know how.
If you never did you should.
These things are fun and fun is good.
Hello hello. Are you there?
Hello! I called you up to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me Joe?
Oh no I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire goodbye!
From near to far from here to there
Funny things are everywhere.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They have one hair upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say
They need a haircut every day.
Who am I? My name is Ish
On my hand I have a dish.
I have this dish to help me wish.
When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say I wish for fish!
And I get fish right on my dish.
So
If you wish to make a wish
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.
