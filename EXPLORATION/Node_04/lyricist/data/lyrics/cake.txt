At first I was afraid
I was petrified
I kept thinking I could never live without you
By my side But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you've done me wrong
I grew strong
I learned how to get along And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you
Here without that look upon your face I should have changed that fucking lock
I would have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me Well now go,
Walk out the door
Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh not I,
I will survive
Yeah
As Long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive
Yeah, yeah
It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart I'm trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry,
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
With somebody new I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you
And so you thought you'd just drop by
And you expect me to be free But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone whose lovin' me
Well now go,
Walk out the door Just turn around
Now, you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire? Did you think I'd crumple?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I,
I will survive Yeah
As long as I know how to love,
I know I'll be alive
I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give
I will survive,
I will survive
Yeah, yeah
Oh no I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes I want a girl with the right allocations
Who's fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She's playing with her jewelry
She's putting up her hair
She's touring the facilities
And picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket. I want a girl who gets up early
I want a girl who stays up late
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete, to cut through red tape With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She's touring the facilities and picking up slack
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket I want a girl with a smooth liquidation
I want a girl with good dividends
At City Bank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She's changing her name
From Kitty to Karen
She's trading her MG for a white Chrysler LeBaron
I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket Reluctantly crouched at the starting line
Engines pumping and thumping in time
The green light flashes, the flags go up
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup
They deftly maneuver and muscle for rank
Fuel burning fast on an empty tank
Reckless and wild, they pour through the turns
Their prowess is potent and secretly stern As they speed through the finish, the flags go down
The fans get up and they get out of town
The arena is empty except for one man
Still driving and striving as fast as he can
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's driving and striving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns He's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (all alone)
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's going the distance
No trophy, no flowers, no flashbulbs, no wine
He's haunted by something he cannot define
Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
Assail him, impale him with monster-truck force
In his mind, he's still driving, still making the grade She's hoping in time that her memories will fade
'Cause he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
The sun has gone down and the moon has come up
And long ago somebody left with the cup
But he's striving and driving and hugging the turns
And thinking of someone for whom he still burns 'Cause he's going the distance
He's going for speed
She's all alone (all alone)
All alone in her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse
He's racing and pacing and plotting the course
He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse He's going the distance
He's going for speed
He's going the distance Ah no, so sad, alright

And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love so much You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (baby)
Baby, you're never there On the phone
long, long distance
always through such strong resistance
First you say you're to busy
I wonder if you even miss me Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (baby)
Baby Take the time to get to know me
If you want me why can't you just show me
Well, always on this roller coaster
If you want me why can't you get closer Never there
You're never there
You're never ever ever ever there
Never there

The barber can give you a haircut
The carpenter can take you out to lunch Now I just want to play on my panpipes

That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
While Frank Sinatra sings "Stormy Weather"
The flies and spiders get along together
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record Beyond the suns that guard this roost
Beyond your flowers of flaming truth
Beyond your latest ad campaigns
An old man sits collecting stamps
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps He saves what others throw away
He says that he'll be rich someday
We know of an ancient radiation
That haunts dismembered constellations
A faintly glimmering radio station
We know of an ancient radiation

But she had a lighter
I had a flame
But she had a fire
I was bright
But she was much brighter
I was high
But she was the sky Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby
I was bound to let you go I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo
I'm never sure what it's all about
But I say I want you
And you don't believe me
You say you want me
But I've got my doubts Oh baby
I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby

Oh baby
I was bound to let you go (All right) When she walks
She swings her arms
Instead of her hips
When she talks she moves her mouth
Instead of her lips And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more
Let me go, let me go
Let me go and I will want you When she wants, she wants the sun
Instead of the moon
When she sees, she sees the stars
Inside of her room And I've waited for her for so long
I have waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on Let me go she said
Let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more

Will turn their backs on you
You'll lose your hair, your teeth
Your knife will fall out of its sheath
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie People you hate
Will get their hooks into you
They'll pull you down, you'll frown
They'll tie you and drag you through town
But you still don't like to leave
Before the end of the movie
No, you still don't like to leave

The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be Launching loony thoughts into the bending of your mind
You reach for something high but it's a mountain that you find
He's a king dust demon with an icepick smile
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly With the mustache man on the carpet of his van
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls
His horn-rimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time He is like a politician who is practicing a speech
He is racing, he is pacing, he is sleeping on his beat
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll
You can feel the oceans rising as you're losing all control And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge
It is past 11:30 and your friends are getting down
They're applying purple eyeshadow, drinking warm beer
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time I have wasted so much time
I have wasted so much time [Instrumental] You've painted up your lips and rolled, and curled your tinted hair
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere?
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore
Yes, it's true that I'm not the man I used to be
Oh Ruby, I still need some company It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby, I realize
But it won't be long, I've heard them say until I'm not around
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town She's leaving now 'cause I just heard the slamming of the door
The way I know I've heard it slam one hundred times before
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
Oh Ruby, for God sakes turn around No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
Ringing stinging Jerking like a nervous bird
Rattling up against his cage
Calls to me throughout the day
See the feathers fly No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today Rhyming chiming got me working all the time
Gives me such a worried mind
Now I don't want to seem unkind
But god (it's such a crime) No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone Shaking quaking
Waking me when I'm asleep
Never lets me go too deep
Summons me with just one beep
The price we pay is steep
I've been on fire
And yet I've still stayed frozen
So deep in the night
My smooth contemplations will always be broken
My deepest concerns will stay buried and unspoken No I don't have any change but here's a few subway tokens
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today
No phone no phone
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today
No phone No phone I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you I want to fly away
I want to fly away I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I'm so sick of work
so sick of play
I don't need another day I need to fly away
I need to fly away Every shiny toy
That at first brings you joy
Will always start to cloy and annoy Every camera every phone
All the music that you own
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone!) Every piece of land
every city that you plan
will crumble into tiny grains of sand Every thing you find that at first gives you shine
always turns into the same old crime (Same old crime!) I want to fly away
I want to fly away
I need to fly away
I need to fly away (I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you)
(I'm so sick of you
so sick of me
I don't want to be with you) Every little dance
Every hidden back romance
All alone (All alone!) In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes
With the freighters towering over me
I can hear the jets flying overhead
Making lines across the darkening sky And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free
And I could get away from you
And you could get away from me
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round In a CD karaoke bar
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round
(Spinning round) (I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know)
Why you say you are not in love with me
(I don't know) It's coming down
It's coming down
It's raining outside
You've nowhere to hide She's asking you why you think it's funny
It's coming down
It's coming down
She's leaving your house She had to get out
She's mad and she'll take her mattress with her
It's coming down

It's coming down It's coming down

She's gone and she's wearing your red sweater
It's coming down

It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down Aw no
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down Well your CD collection looks shiny and costly.
How much did you pay for your bad Moto Guzzi?
And how much did you spend on your black leather jacket?
Is it you or your parents in this income tax bracket? Now tickets to concerts and drinking at clubs
Sometimes for music that you haven't even heard of.
And how much did you pay for your rock'n'roll t shirt
That proves you were there That you heard of them first?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle? Ah, tell me.
How much did you pay for the chunk of his guitar,
The one he ruthlessly smashed at the end of the show?
And how much will he pay for a brand new guitar, One which he'll ruthlessly smash at the end of another show?
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones?
As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.
And how long will the workers keep building him new ones? As long as their soda cans are red, white, and blue ones.
Aging black leather and hospital bills,
Tattoo removal and dozens of pills.
Your liver pays dearly now for youthful magic moments, But rock on completely with some brand new components.
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle?
How do you afford your rock'n'roll lifestyle? Excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling.
Your self-destruction doesn't hurt them.
Your chaos won't convert them. They're so happy to rebuild it.
You'll never really kill it.
Yeah, excess ain't rebellion.
You're drinking what they're selling. Excess ain't rebellion.

He said i gave myself to enjoy pleasure
What are teenagers doing today?
They're trying every thrill there is in the books.
We got color TV.
But it is still isn't satisfying. Man is born, man lives, and man dies
And it's all vanity. You can't understand it
It's going so loud and so forth
And they're a-wigglin' and a-wobblin' around
And everything else
And, and, and yet they're not satisfied
And, and these disc jockeys,
They hear the tune that is different. Man is born, man lives, and man dies
And it's all vanity. You can't understand it
It's going so loud and so forth
And they're a-wigglin' and a-wobblin' around
And everything else
And, and, and yet they're not satisfied
And, and these disc jockeys,
They hear the tune that is different.
They hear the tune that is different. Man is born, man lives, and man dies

Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard
Call me morbid or absurd
But To me

Friend is a four letter word
End is the only part of the word
That I heard

But To me
Coming from you
Friend is a four letter word
When I go fishing
for the words
I am wishing you would say to me,
I am really only praying that
The words you'll soon be saying
Might betray The way you feel about me
But to me,
Coming from you,
Friend is a four letter word I've got wheels of polished steel
I've tires that grab the road
I've got seats that selflessly hold my friends
And a trunk that can carry the heaviest of loads I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand I've got brakes I'm wide awake
I can stop this car at any time
At the very last second I can change directions
Turn completely around if I feel so inclined I've got a mind that can steal me to your house
And a heart that can bring you red flowers
My intentions are good and earnest and true
But under my hood is internal combustion power
And Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is my motor
Hear my motor purr
Satan is the only one who seems to understand
Satan is my motor When you tried to kiss me
I only bit your tongue.
When you tried to get me together
I only came undone.
When you tried to tell me
The one for me was you,
I was in your mattress back in 1982. Daria, I won't be soothed.
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,
Smoothed over like milk,
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,
Icing on a cake,
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria, Daria, Daria,
I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed. When you tried to tell me
Of all the love you had,
I was cleaning oil from beaches
Seeing only what was bad.
When you tried to feed me
I only shut my mouth.
Food got on your apron
And you told me to get out. Daria, I won't be soothed.
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,
Smoothed over like milk,
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,
Icing on a cake,
Or a serene translucent lake.
Daria, Daria, Daria,
Daria, Daria, Daria,
Daria, I won't be soothed.
I won't be soothed. Dis empowered, the scattering flock
Dances in a fever at the castle rock
Dust-devil cypress and ripening fruit
Ascending quick into the author's bathroom Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say to you
I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you Uninvited, we'll stay if we want
Searching through your closets for your grandfather's gun
We will swim in your kidney, kidney-shaped pool
Scratching at the bottom for another clue, yeah Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude
And there's nothing I can do (Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude)
And there's nothing I can say to you
(Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude) And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can say to you
I've got a lot of work to do
I guess I'll leave it up to you There's a long line of cars
And they're trying to get through
There's no single explanation
There's no central destination But this long line of cars
Is trying to get through
And this long line of cars
Is all because of you
You don't wonder where we're going
Or remember where we've been
We've got to keep this traffic
Flowing and accept a little spin So this long line of cars
Will never have an end
And this long line of cars
Keeps coming around the bend
From the streets of sacramento
To the freeways of L.A.
We've got to keep this fire burning
And accept a little gray
So this long line of cars
Is trying to break free
And this long line of cars
Is all because of me This long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars
Long line of cars She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Writing your own headlines
Ignoring your own deadlines
But now you've gotta' write them all again. You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x2]
You want her, confront her, just open your window
Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch
You want it, confront it, just open your window
All you really have to do is ask
But you're caught in your own glory
You are believing your own stories
Timing your contractions
Inventing small contraptions
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors [Chorus[
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x2]
You think she's an open book
But you don't know which page to turn to
Do you [Repeat: x3] I am an opera singer
i stand on painted tape
It tells me where I'm going
And where to throw my cape
I call my co-stars brother
I call my co-stars name
I play both good and evil parts
I sing to Verdi's grave And every single morning
By 10 a.m I'm dressed
My rehearsals last for hours and hours
With diligence I have been blessed
Some people, they call me monster
Some people, they call me saint
My talent feeds my darker side
Yet no-one will complain I am an opera singer
I sing in foreign lands
I've sung for Kings in Europe
And Emperors in Japan And after each performance
People stand around and wait
Just to tell me that they loved my voice
Just to tell me that I'm great
I am an opera singer
I will sing when you're all dead
I sing the mountains crumbling apart
I sing what can't be said Heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face, from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Now heads of state who ride and wrangle
Who look at your face from more than one angle
Can cut you from their bloated budgets
Like sharpened knives through chicken Mc Nuggets Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers
Will eat your children and steal your thunder
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl
Who crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up
Shut the fuck up
Learn to buck up Now simple feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Now clever feet that flicker like fire
And burn like candles in smoky spires
Do more to turn my joy to sadness
Than somber thoughts of burning planets Your pentagram is down below our floor.
Your naked body shimmers in the night.
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies
Who have passed the test just like all the rest
But never really understood the reasons why
They took it in the first place.
Ah in the first place.
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart.
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place.
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,
But never really understood the reasons why
I took it in the first place.
Ah, in the first place. In the brown shag carpet of a cheap motel
In the dark and dusty corner by the TV shelf
Is a small reminder of a simpler time
When a crumpled up pair of trousers cost a brand new dime Well you ask me how I made it through?
And how my mint condition could belong to you?
When I'm on the ground, I roll through town
I'm a president you don't remember getting kicked around I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine, I'm freshly minted
I am determined not to be dented
By a car or by a plane or anything not yet invented I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine In the hiss and rumble of the freeway sounds
As the afternoon commuters drive their cars around
There's a ringle jingle near the underpass
There's a sparkle near the fast food garbage and roadside trash I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine, I'm freshly minted
I'm silver plated, I'm underrated
You won't even pick me up
Because I'm not enough for a local phone call I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine
I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine
I'm a dime
I'm fine
And I shine I don't want to hear you whisper
I don't want to orbit your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two I don't like to hang around you
I don't want to live in your world of two There's only room for you
In your world of two It's not that I don't like you
But it's not that I don't love you
It's not that I don't think you are
Two of the most
Perfectly
Beautiful
People in your world In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
In your world of two
There's only room
There's only room
There's only room
For you Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd float down to the sea Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd say just what you please
Without the sticky little kitten
Your ticket could never be free Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancer would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd burn all these dying leaves Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd lift this steaming herd
You would kill all the sick ones
You would bury them deep in the earth Without the tight little denim
Your virtues would all go unknown
Without the room that you live in
Your cancers would eat to the bone Your muscles would bulge underground
Your demons would all be around
Without the pretty pink ribbon
You'd end up just like me Stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat But when we're driving in my Malibu
It?s easy to get right next to you
I say, "Baby, scoot over, please"
And then she's right there next to me I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat Alright
Well a lot of good cars are Japanese
Yeah, but when we're driving far I need my baby
I need my baby next to me Well, stickshifts and safetybelts
Bucket seats have all got to go
When we're driving in the car
It makes my baby seem so far I need you here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat
I need you to be here with me
Not way over in a bucket seat Alright

People just getting lazy, complaining Arco Arena
Arco Arena She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
She doesn't care just as long as his ship's coming in
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
They laugh they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
that bounce on his Italian leather sofa.
She doesn't care whether or not he's a good man
She doesn't care just as long as she still has her friends
She doesn't care whether or not he's an island
they laugh, they make money
He's got a gold watch
She's got a silk dress and healthy breasts
That bounce on his Italian leather sofa
She's got a serrated edge
that she moves back and forth
It's such a simple machine she doesn't have to use force
When she gets what she wants,
she puts the rest on a tray in a ziplock bag

Like she'd done one hundred times before.
Jolene smoothed her dark hair in the mirror.
She folded the towel carefully and put it back in place. Yeah I want to pull you down into bed.
I want to cast your face in lead.
Well every time I pull you close
Push my face into your hair Cream rinse and tobacco smoke
That sickly scent is always always there.
Jolene heard her father's uneven snores.
Right then she knew there must be something more. Jolene heard the singing in the forest.
She opened the door quietly and stepped into the night.
Yeah I want to throw you out into space.
I want to do whatever it takes, takes, takes. You keep pushing me away
In spite of what you say
I found out yesterday that I've
Been wasting all my time Trying to make you smile
Trying to make this seem worthwhile
You've been pushing me around
In spite of what I do
Trying to make things good for you Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away You've been racing through my mind
You're picking up in speed
You're driving recklessly
It's like a car crash happening on my street Broken bodies at my feet
And sirens on the way They're too late
'Cause nobody's going to save us
We're a rubbernecker's dream
We're burning gasoline Go
Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away And go
Go ahead and destroy this
Better come with an army
Are you feeling, feeling okay, baby? Uh huh
Na na
Na na, na na, na
Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na Take your economy car and your suitcase
Take your psycho little dogs
Take it all away Cool blue reason empties on the page
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies in reign
Cool blue reason comes into your world
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change like seasons
Only eight more hours to go Cool blue reason comes into your life
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging Hell
I'm just talking to myself
I'm just talking to myself Cool blue reason wraps around your throat
The minutes change likes seasons
Only eight more hours to go
Only eight more hours to go
Only eight more hours left to go Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord, yeah! Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight
They leave that role to the poor
Yeah
Time will tell them they have power minds
Making war just for fun
Treating like people just like pawns in chess
Wait until that judgment day comes
Yeah!
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!) Now in darkness world stops turning
As you hear the bodies burning
No more war pigs have the power
And as god has struck the hour
They have judgment
God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling
Making mercies for their sins
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh lord, yeah! A mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky
Do you remember now, the oblivion of youthful minds,
caught up in the fashions of their time...
Roll away,
I can see that clearly now, every time I look into this
mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky
A mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky
Piecemeal of yesteryear,
a stained glass moment marking time,
with full intent on my 22 year old mind
Roll away,
I can see that clearly now,
every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky,
nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky
What would they say?
God is here in this country by the sky The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. Parking lots, office parks and shopping malls
And all you left were bills you hadn't paid.
The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year
And something in my mind just got away It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now,
You're moving on, on, on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa Alcohol, cigarettes and luxury goods,
Christmas lights look desperate in this room.
Winter's light left me in the dark last night
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom. Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind
And autumn's leaves have all been blown away.
Being in the places where we used to be
Somehow being there without you's not the same. It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now,
You're moving on, on, on.
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa It's all behind you now,
You're moving on.
They'll never find you now,
You're moving on, on, on.

Best, best, best Once I thought two happy hearts
Could someday beat as one
But then the third heart came along
And now our love is gone
I count the many times I've said
I love no one but you
But don't be fooled by
Counting dreams that never will come true Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartache Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Divide the tears by every time a heart breaks
The answer only tells us that it's too late
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches
Subtract one love, and multiply the heartaches Who draws the crowd, who plays so loud?
Baby, it's the guitar man
Who's gonna steal the show, you know?
Baby, it's the guitar man He can make you love
He can make you cry
He will break you down
An' he will get you high And something keeps him going
Miles and miles away
To find another place to play And night after night, who treats you right?
Baby, it's the guitar man
And who's on the radio, you know?
Baby, it's the guitar man When he comes to town
And you see his face
And you think you might
Like to take his place Something keeps him drifting
Miles and miles away
Searching for the songs to play Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own
And take 'em home [Incomprehensible]
Ya
Ohh, ho He can make you love
He can get you high
And he will bring you down
He will make you cry Something keeps him moving
But no one seems to know
What it is that makes him go? Then the lights being to flicker and the sound is getting dim
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
But he never seems to notice
He's just gotta find another place to play Anyway
Got to play
Anyway
Aaa aaa
... You have always got to move,
You're always trying to prove that,
There is something new in,
Everything you do. You are mostly in your car,
You always seem so far,
No matter where you are,
You're thinking of your car, And everything you say,
Is really just a play,
For you to get your way,
And I found out yesterday,
That no matter what you say,
And no matter what you do,
That you have got to... You have always got to move,
You're racing just to prove that,
There is something new,
In everything you do. You are mostly on the phone,
You say you're coming home,
You say you're all alone,
But I know you're not alone. And everything you say,
Is really just a play,
For you to get your way,
And I found out yesterday,
That no matter what you say,
And no matter what you do,
That you have got to move. You have always got to move,
You're racing just to prove that,
There is something new in,
Everything you do. Repeat X3 When the house was standing
You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
The bricks and mortar, have all given way
At first, they resisted, but then they began to sway How can you say, forever, is at your command?
How can you say, the future's in the palm, in the palm of your hand? When the house was standing
You'd never have believed it
When the house was standing
You'd never have believed
That gaping hole, was, once a foundation
Where you stand now were tools in a basement and How can you say, forever, is at your command?
How can you say, the future's in the palm, in the palm of your hand? You won't admit you love me
And so how am I ever to know?
You only tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps A million times I ask you
And then I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't wanna wind up
Being parted, broken hearted So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't, dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps
Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sun set
I'll never forget
Watching all the reds and oranges slip away
Letting go of yet another dirty day Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun
Watching the sun go down Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching you leave me
Not quite believing
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sun set
I'll never forget Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun
Watching the sun go down
Breathing in the fumes from so many idling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun
Watching the sun go down
Watching the sun, the sun
Watching the sun go down
Watching the, the sun, go down You part the waters
The same ones that I'm drowning in
You lead your casual slaughters
And I'm the one who helps you win
You've got your grand piano You don't even play piano
I'm the one who plays piano
You don't even play piano
You part the waters The same ones that I'm thirsty for
You invite your friends to tea
But when it's me you lock the door
You've got your credit cards And you thank your lucky stars.
But don't forget the ones who foot the bill
You've got your grand piano
And you don't even play piano I can't believe it's true, I can't believe that you
Don't want me anymore
You're with him and you don't even know That I've been dying all day long
And singing sad, sad songs
And wishing you were gone Ha, is this love?
Oh, is this love?
Is this love?
Or should I close the door? Yea, my eyes are burning in my head
And seeing only red
And wishing you were dead Is this love?
Oh, is this love?
Is this love?
Oh, no is this love? I don't thing so
Is this love?
Or should I
Or should I, should I
Should I close the door?
Should I close the door? Aah, I fooled myself
Yea, alright, okay Is this love? Tell me
Is this love? I don't thing so
(Is this love?)
Is this love?
Oh, no is this love?
Is this love?
Or should I
Or should I
Or should I, should I
Should I close the door? Up so close I never get to see your face.
Microscope I might as well be out in space.
Up so close I never get to see the view.
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you. Up your nose down to your toes.
In your mouth way down south.
Up so close it seems I only think of you.
Up so close I never see the sky so blue. I only wanted to be sure
That what it was was really pure.
I put my face down in the cake.
My feet were flailing in a lake. Up so close, I never get to see your face.
Microscope, I might as well be out in space.
Up so close, I never get to see you.
Microscope, I'm never sure if it's still you. The land of race car ya-yas

You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.
Yeah come Comanche Comanche Comanche commode.
If you want to have cities you've got to build roads.
You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes.
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load.

Do you think it's all just murky green?
Don't you think that she would realize?
Yeah do you think she has never seen?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low
When the waves retire to the darkness below
I know I know Ruby sees all.
I know I know Ruby sees.
I can feel the pressure building high.
You should see you're headed for a storm.
Don't you see it building in the sky?
Don't you think it's time to swim to shore?
Cause when the seaweed sinks and the sun gets low,
When the waves retire to the darkness below,
I know, I know Ruby sees all.
I know, I know Ruby sees all.
I know, I know Ruby sees. At first I was afraid.
I was petrified.
I kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side.
But then I spent so many nights
Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along.
And so you're back from outer space.
I just walked in to find you here
Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me. Go on now go.
Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.
You're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one
Who tried to break me with desire?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I. I will survive.
As long as I know how to love
I know I'll be alive.
I've got all my life to live.
I've got all my love to give.
I will survive.
I will survive. I'm writing a song all about you
A true song as real as my tears
But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even
With you 'cause you're leavin'
But sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year
It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it
Sad songs and waltzes aren't selling this year You should've told me when it all began
You should've told me long ago
Someday I know you're gonna find
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again And if the doubting faces made you go
It's only mine that matters now
Those looks will soon begin to fade
If you come back and show them all you're not afraid What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again Now that you know how much I understand
You have no reason to be gone
And if you feel at all like me
Just let me know, I'll make it like it used to be What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all
And we can still begin again
What's now is now
And I'll forget what happened then
I know it all (I know it all)
And we can still begin again
What's now is now (now is now) That Italian guy over there
The one with the polyester pinstriped suit
The one with the gray hair and mustache
Must be thinking really loud thoughts
Because he's nodding and squinting and nodding and squinting
And putting down his metal cane
Like he's making a point, and it's very important indeed
Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed
Yeah, he's making a point, and it's very important indeed She'll hang the baskets on the walls
Don't you know I've seen it all before She'll hang the baskets on the walls
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door
Come summer, come fall
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor He'll go to buy her turtle wax
But in his mind, he won't be coming back She'll hang the baskets on the walls
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door

She'll hang the baskets on the walls Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
Over our busy little cars
Clouds hung hugely and oppressively
We didn't notice, we didn't care, we didn't notice Driving along in our luxury cars
Down to our pretty city of stars
Down to our pretty city of stars in our eyes
Money in pockets, mugs on TV, plugs in the sockets You know it would be easy, so easy
It would be easy
It would be easy, so easy
It would be easy to crash School teachers, beggars, bankers, Congressmen
Stargazers didn't see a thing
Stockbrokers, singers, dancers, architects
(Stars in our eyes)
We didn't notice, we didn't care, we didn't notice
(Mugs on TV)
Plugs in the sockets You know it would be easy, so easy

Then they flap their wings at the last second.
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.
Then they flap their wings at the last second.
I can see their dead weight
Just dropping like stones
For small loaves of bread
Past my window all the time.
But unless I get up
Walk across the room
And peer down below
I don't see their last second curves
Toward a horizontal flight.
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.
Now due to a construct in my mind
That makes their falling and their flight
Symbolic of my entire existence,
It becomes important for me
To get up and see
Their last second curves toward flight.
It's almost as if my life will fall
Unless I see their ascent.

Walk across the room
And peer down below,
I won't see their last second curves
Toward a, a horizontal flight.

You tear down the bridge
Flimsy as it is,
It's business like.
You shake my hand
You break up the band
Flimsy as it is,
It's open mike
punk rock
Red white and blue,
You twist the knife
Then go home to kiss your wife
A bigger better slice
is what you'd like
You kick the sand
You get the upper hand
You sell it to Japan
It's natural
Punk rock
Red white and blue You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why And the cement mixer gets it all ready
One good turn at a time
Then pouring it slowly and steady
You're showing me where I can sign
What I can expect to find
But how you can you say you'll be happy
When you turn the screws You turn the screws
It's what you choose to do
You think that I
Must turn them too
You think that I
Must be so satisfied
I stay inside
I wonder why Excuse Me, I Think I've Got A Heartache
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive) They just don't know how lost I feel without you
My teardrops never see the light of day
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow
I live a lie in all I do and say
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow
But if I told the truth I'd have to say... Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
There's an aching deep inside
And it just won't be denied Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache
And I'd better say goodbye
Before I cry I'm writing a song all about you

Exchanging glances
Wandering the night,
What were the chances
We'd be sharing love
Before the night was through Something in your eyes
Was so inviting
Something in your smile
Was so exciting
Something in my heart
Told me I must have you Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away And ever since that night
We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right I'm sitting by the window of your 32nd floor apartment
Waiting for your phone calls all to end
I'm sitting, watching wind blow, watching time go, watching cars go by
I'm waiting for these memories to begin If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Garbage trucks and taxi cabs don't seem like they can reach me here
The clamor of jackhammers seems so faint
Well the way you treat me like the only slightly brings me down a lot
I don't think that I'll ever be the same If I threw my guitar
Out the window so far down
Would I start to regret it?
Or would I smile and watch it slowly fall, fall, fall? Keep on, keep on doing it
Right on, right on doing it
Baby, keep on Right on
Keep on doing it
Now my baby keep on
Keep on, keep on Wherever, wherever girl, I'll do it
Forever and ever, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll see you through it I've got to keep you pleased
In every way I can
Gonna give you all of me
As much as you can stand Make love to you right now
That's all I want to do
I know you need it, girl
And you know I need it, too 'Cause I found
What the world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And, oh, my babe
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Not the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
I'm gonna stay right here with you
Do all the things you want me to Whatever you want
Girl, you got it
And whatever you need
I don't want to see you without it You've given me much more
Than words could ever say
And oh, my dear, I'll be right here
Until my dying day I don't know just how to say
All the things I feel
I just know that I love you so
And it gives me such a thrill 'Cause I found
What this world is searching for
Here, right here, my dear
I don't have to look no more And all of my days
I hoped and I prayed
For someone just like you
To make me feel the way you do I'm never, never gonna give ya up
I'm never, ever gonna stop
Stop the way I feel about you
Girl, I just can't live without you I'm never ever gonna quit
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick
