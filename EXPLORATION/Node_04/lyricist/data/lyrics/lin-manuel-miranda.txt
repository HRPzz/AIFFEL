How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence impoverished,
In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar? The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education, don't forget from whence you came
And the world is gonna know your name
What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick And Alex got better but his mother went quick Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside voice saying
Alex, you gotta fend for yourself He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on the bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man Just you wait Alexander Hamilton We are waiting in the wings for you You could never back down
You never learned to take your time Oh, Alexander Hamilton When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote your game?
The world will never be the same, oh The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom His enemies destroyed his rep America forgot him We fought with him Me, I died for him Me, I trusted him Me, I loved him And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine It's the Ten Duel Commandments It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one The challenge, demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action Number two If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned Number three
Have your seconds meet face to face Negotiate a peace Or negotiate a time and place This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility You have him turn around so he can have deniability Five Duel before the sun is in the sky Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell 'em where you been
Pray that hell or heaven lets you in Seven Confess your sins
Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent Number eight Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight Alexander Aaron Burr, sir Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature? Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous? Okay, so we're doin' this Number nine Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count One two three four Five six seven eight nine Number Ten paces Fire How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo
Turns out we have a secret weapon
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman Lafayette I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains Lafayette And I'm never gonna stop until I make 'em
Drop and burn 'em up and scatter their remains, I'm Lafayette Watch me engagin' em, escapin' em
Enragin' em
I'm Lafayette I go to France for more funds Lafayette I come back with more Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there's someone else we need I know Hamilton Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean Hamilton Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench?
I mean Hamilton No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance Hamilton You wanna fight for your land back? (Hamilton) I need my right hand man back (Hamilton) Ah, uh, get ya right hand man back (Hamilton)
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back (Hamilton) I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better
To get your right hand man back Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers who will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
I'm 'a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Every burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me, he says in parentheses Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to onarchy?
Onarchy how you say, how you say, anarchy?
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my, shot Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
I'm gonna take a shot But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another shot Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught
If you talk, you're gonna get shot Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud Let's get this guy in front of a crowd I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot

Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?

When are these colonies gonna rise up? Rise up
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty Scratch that this is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
'Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states what's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin' I'm passionatelymashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot We're gonna rise up (time to take a shot)

Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for Can I buy you a drink?
That would be nice While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice

We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went boom
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine Grab my sister, and
Whisper, yo, this one's mine My sister made her way across the room to you (ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking what's she gonna do? (ooh)
She grabbed you by the arm, I'm thinkin' I'm through (ooh)
Then you look back at me and suddenly I'm (ooh)
Helpless Oh, look at those eyes Look into your eyes

It's a pleasure to meet you Schuyler? My sister Thank you for all your service If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it I'll leave you to it One week later I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him Ha

'Cause there's nothing that your mind can't do
My father makes his way across the room
To you (ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking
We're through (ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says
Be true (ooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I'm
Helpless Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em
I'm helpless Look into your eyes
And the sky's the
Limit I'm
Helpless
Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so Eliza I've never felt so My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it I do I do I do I do Down for the count
And I'm drownin' in 'em In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man
In New York, you can be a new man Helpless Mister Vice President
Mister Madison
Senator Burr
What is this? We have the check stubs, from separate accounts
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts To a Mister James Reynolds way back in
Seventeen ninety-one Is that what you have, are you done?
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position Though 'virtue' is not a word I'd apply to this situation
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation
An immigrant embezzling our government funds I can almost see the headline, your career is done
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from Ha you don't even know what you're asking me to confess Confess You have nothing, I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless Unless If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw? No one else was in the room where it happened Is that a yes? Um, yes Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me, down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to What She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list n' see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction? My God
Gentlemen, let's go
So? The people won't know what we know Burr
How do I know you won't use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe? Alexander, rumors only grow
And we both know what we know I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
I'm 'a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal my power of speech, unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Every burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R we are meant to be A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me, he says in parentheses Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to onarchy?
Onarchy how you say, how you say, anarchy?
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my, shot Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
I'm gonna take a shot But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another shot Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught
If you talk, you're gonna get shot Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud Let's get this guy in front of a crowd I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot Everybody sing
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa
Ay, let 'em hear ya Let's go Whoa, whoa, whoa I said shout it to the rooftops
Whoa, whoa, whoa said, to the rooftops
Whoa, whoa, whoa come on Come on, let's go
Rise up
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up? Rise up
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep, seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty Scratch that this is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
'Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states what's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin' I'm passionatelymashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot We're gonna rise up (time to take a shot)
We're gonna rise up (time to take a shot)
We're gonna, rise up, rise up It's time to take a shot
Rise up, rise up, it's time to take a shot
Rise up, it's time to take a shot
Rise up, take a shot, shot, shot
It's time to take a shot, time to take a shot
And I am not throwing away my shot
Not throwing away my shot Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya My mother was a genius My father commanded respect When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it Wait for it

Climb
Climb He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose Lose
Lose

He wastes no time Time
Time
Time What is it like in his shoes? Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit I'm willing to wait for it I'm willing to wait for it Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints

Wait I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said "Be careful with that one, love
He will do what it takes to survive" You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers in every line
For some kind of sign, and when you were mine
The world seemed to burn
Burn You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?
She said
"You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun" You and your words, obsessed with your legacy
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you You, you, you I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart, I'm watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories of when you were mine
I hope that you burn The issue on the table, France is on the verge of war with England
And do we provide aid and troops to our French allies
Or do we stay out of it, remember
My decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
The only person you have to convince is me
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir When we were on death's door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds France In return, they didn't ask for land
Only a promise that we'd lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I'll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation Ooh Hey, and if ya don't know, now ya know, Mister President Thank you, Secretary Jefferson Secretary Hamilton, your response You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it
Should we honor our treaty, King Louis' head
Uh do whatever you want, I'm super dead Enough, Hamilton is right Mister President We're too fragile to start another fight But sir, do we not fight for freedom Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em The people are leading The people are rioting
There's a difference, frankly
It's a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton Sir Draft a statement of neutrality Did you forget Lafayette What Have you an ounce of regret
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line So quick witted Alas, I admit it I bet you were quite a lawyer My defendants got acquitted Yeah, well, someone oughta remind you What You're nothing without Washington behind you Hamilton Daddy's calling In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn't drown
I couldn't seem to die I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn't seem to die Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (I'll write my way out)
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it (write everything down, far as I can see)
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait (history has its eyes on you) I'll write my way out
Overwhelm them with honesty This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait The Reynolds Pamphlet Mister President, you asked to see me I know you're busy What do you need, sir Sir
I wanna give you a word of warning Sir, I don't know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning You're kidding I need a favor Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior Shh, talk less I'll use the press
I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him I need you to draft an address Yes, he resigned, you can finally speak your mind No, he's stepping down so he can run for President Ha, good luck defeating you, sir I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President I'm sorry, what One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let's take a break tonight
And then we'll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I No, sir, why I wanna talk about neutrality Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time I want to warn against partisan fighting But Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard won wisdom I have earned As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve No, one last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We're gonna teach 'em how to say
Goodbye
You and I Mister President, they will say you're weak No, they will see we're strong Your position is so unique So I'll use it to move them along Why do you have to say goodbye If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I'm gone
Like the scripture says
Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we've made
One last time One last time Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration
I am unconscious of intentional error
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects
Not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors
I shall also carry with me The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence
And that
After forty five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion
As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat
In which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking
In the midst of my fellow citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart
And the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers One last time George Washington's going home Teach 'em how to say goodbye George Washington's going home You and I George Washington's going home Going home George Washington's going home History has its eyes on you George Washington's going home We're gonna teach 'em how to say goodbye (teach 'em how to say goodbye) Teach 'em how To say goodbye To say goodbye (say goodbye) Say goodbye (say goodbye) One last time Seventeen seventy-six
New York City
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir? That depends, who's asking? Oh, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you I'm getting nervous Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours
I may have punched him it's a blur, sir
He handles the financials? You punched the bursar? Yes, I wanted to do what you did
Graduate in two, then join the revolution he looked at me like I was stupid I'm not stupid So how'd you do it, how'd you graduate so fast? It was my parent's dying wish before they passed You're an orphan, of course I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war
Then we could prove that we're worth more than anyone bargained for Can I buy you a drink?
That would be nice While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less What? Smile more Ha Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for You can't be serious You wanna get ahead? Yes Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead Yo yo yo yo yo
What time is it? Show time Like I said Show time, show time
Yo, I'm John Lauren's in the place to be
Two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh
Those redcoats don't want it with me
'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set
I came from afar just to say bonsoir
Tell the king casse-toi
Who's the best, c'est moi Brrrah, brraaah I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said come again Ay, lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets (wow) No more sex, pour me another brew, son
Let's raise a couple more to the revolution Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college Aaron Burr Give us a verse, drop some knowledge Good luck with that, you're takin' a stand
You spit, I'm 'a sit
We'll see where we land (boo) Burr, the revolution's imminent, what do you stall for? If you stand for nothing Burr, what'll you fall for? Oh, who are you oh, who are you oh, who are you?
Oh, who is this kid, what's he gonna do? How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore
And a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence impoverished,
In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar? The ten-dollar founding father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away
Across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain Well, the word got around, they said, this kid is insane, man
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education, don't forget from whence you came
And the world is gonna know your name
What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick And Alex got better but his mother went quick Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside voice saying
Alex, you gotta fend for yourself He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf There would have been nothin' left to do for someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on the bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man Just you wait Alexander Hamilton We are waiting in the wings for you You could never back down
You never learned to take your time Oh, Alexander Hamilton When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote your game?
The world will never be the same, oh The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom His enemies destroyed his rep America forgot him We fought with him Me, I died for him Me, I trusted him Me, I loved him And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait What's your name, man? Alexander Hamilton The issue on the table: a petition from a Quaker delegation in Philadelphia calling on Congress to end the African slave trade and abolish slavery, in all its forms. This petition was written and signed by Benjamin Franklin, it cannot go ignored. If this comes to a vote in Congress, what is the White House's position? Secretary Jefferson, you first. Tread lightly... Sir
The constitution clearly states
That the states have to wait
Until eighteen-oh-eight to debate
On whether to end the slave trade
And whether or not you want it, guys
That is the final compromise we made Sir wait- But for a second let us say that we can legislate
Unanimous emancipation, freedom reigns, and yes, it's great
We cannot cure prejudice or righteous, desperate hate
So back to Africa or do they get a separate state?
In 1784, I tried to float banning slavery in the West
My notion didn't get a single vote
Slavery's a sin, it's growing like a cancer
But we can't address the question if we do not have an answer Is it my turn? Good
Plantation states are packed with promise makers
Do you realize the precious time these legislators wasted?
Institutionalizing slavery only multiplies our troubles
Wait till the 1800's, and their population doubles
You all know
This is the stain on our soul and democracy
A land of the free? No, it's not, it's hypocrisy
To subjugate, dehumanize a race, call 'em property
And say that we are powerless to stop it, can you not foresee?
Sir, even you, you have hundreds of slaves
Whose descendants will curse our names when we're safe in our graves
How will the south find labor for its businesses?
How will Thomas Jefferson find his next mistresses? How dare you Yet still, people follow like lemmings
All your hemming and hawing, while you're hee-hawing with Sally Hemings That's enough Well you asked how I feel
I don't pretend to know the answer, but the question is real If I may, Mr. President?
Madison?
Let's take this moment to establish a precedent
First of all, sir, we won't involve you in this
Imagine this debate with all of congress, it's ruinous
I'll reassure the South, 1808 is still the year
That was agreed upon
That buys us time and assuages fear
I'll tell the North that on January 1st
Of that year, we'll ban importation handling the worst
Once I get all this agreed upon, I'll pick up a pen
And introduce a notion never to discuss this again Mr President! Hamilton, if we support emancipation
Every single slave owner will demand compensation
And as for slandering Jefferson with talk of mistresses
Do you really wanna- Do you really wanna have that conversation? No Madison, execute your plan to the letter
Let's hope the next generation thinks of something better I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them, I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said "Be careful with that one, love
