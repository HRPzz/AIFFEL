Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me
It seems like just the other day
It ain't it funny, funny, funny how time just slips away It's a funny thing about the time
It's funny baby, how time slips away I started to write this song about you
And then I decided that I would write it all about love
And it appeared to me
That you wasn't happy
And that's for sure, positively That's what the world is made of
So give me more L-O-V-E, love
Love is a walk down Main street (oh love)
Love is an apple that is so sweet (love)
Love is something that can't be beat (love) L-O-V-E is strange to me, Oh
I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
It's all in the heavens, can't you see
You can always depend on me
To give you love Love is a flower in my soul (oh love)
Love is a story that just can't be told (love)
Can't you feel it burning more and more (love)
Stop and look at the big wheel roll I can't explain this feeling
Can't you see that salvation is freeing
I would give my life for the glory
Just to be able to tell the story About love
I didn't mean to make you mad
A sweet story, I thought I had
But maybe time will bring us together And I can be such a happy fella
About love
Love is something that is so divine (oh love)
Love is a feeling that's a friend of mine (love) It can't be measured by no sign (love)
In your heart or even in your mind
About love, Love is as bright as the morning sun Darling you must know that you are only mine
Not for just right now but all the time
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
Are the only things that you said on the day we met This love I try to fight but I couldn't know love too long
And I knew the way that I was, I wouldn't be round too long
Your sweet ways I cannot forget
When I think about all the things you said
To help me through my days Now I need you more desperately than I ever did
All the things we've done, all the things you say
Just drives me outta my head So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I want you to stay with me, baby, yeah
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever? Please take my love, that's all I have to give
Just right now you're giving me a reason to live
Help me understand what I feel is real
For no love has meant this much to me
In the past couple of years And if you let me there is nothing I wouldn't do for you
And if you trust me with your love
Then I will make your dreams come true So baby, please, please, won't you stay with me forever?
I just want you to stay a while with me, baby
Please, please, won't you stay with me forever?

I think if love could've found
My heart was lost and now it's found
Belle
Let's you and I let the love come down I'm so happy, let me say this,

Can turn a river into a raging flood
I can live forever if I so decide
Ain't happy am I with all the powers that I possess,
Oh, you're the key, 'cause
I can't get next to you, babe
Can't get next to you.
I've been trying for such a long time Let me tell you that

We used to take our time
You'd write me a letter, baby
And I'd wait for you all night (oh)

Rushing around including you and I
I wanna take a little time Just to fall in love again
Cause they're telling me [Chorus] When I think about yesterday
Everything was easy
Everything was okay
(Now, now, now)
Now everything is going fast
You're the best thing I ever had
Aw and losing you

Can try to hurry me (can try to hurry me) [Chorus:Repeat x3] I guess there's no good reason for livin'...
But I'll keep on livin' for you, baby...
There's nothing else to do, babe...
But spend my life holding you and lovin' you... Oh...
If I ask you more than one million times to forgive me...
You think of a reason why...
That you should make me cry (don't make me cry)...
Walk out and say goodbye away from me... Oh...

When you know you ain't goin' nowhere...
But here with me...

It's been a long, a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will Then I go to see my brother
And I say him to help me please
And he just winds up knockin' me

Oh, a shot rings out another Mother's child is fallen
Never will her life be the same
The streets are filled with anger and with heartbreak
People trying to ease the pain
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind (Yea)
Oh but this wicked shade our city
People saying it's a Pity
We all got a price to pay Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone (ask anybody)
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave... The time has come to play the game of violence
All around the world it's the same (same, same)
Why can't we see?
We all got to share the responsibility
We all the blame
There was a time we could walk the street with some peace of mind
Oh not today
We got to fight the fears that seize us
Make them a believe us
We all in this together
And we all got to take a stand Chorus
We got to leave the guns at home
We can't make in this world alone
We got to leave the guns at home
Knowing we can't win this prize alone The time is right
We all must lead the fight
To answer to somebody
Everything going change
The stake points in this game
We must love one another
(Love one another)

Oh baby... I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home (And ooh yeah, now)
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day,
You know it's always been that way (Ooh yeah, now)
And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop (ooh, ya'll)
The girl is right on time now (come on) Her loving arms are there to greet me,
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me.
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way (One woman's making my home)
One women's making my home
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
The other girl is making me do wrong
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no baby
I got to decide where I belong. (One woman's making my home)
Sometimes I get so mixed up inside
(But the other woman's making me wrong)
I wish I could find a place to hide
I didn't mean, I didn't mean
I didn't mean to let it get that strong, no girl
I got to decide, where I belong (One woman's making my home)
Baby baby baby... Oh baby What's taking you so long?
