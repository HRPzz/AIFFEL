Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy Roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
You forget so easily
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
Moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body
Someone's son or someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body
I'm gonna go to sleep
Let this wash all over me
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe around, tie him down
We don't want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe around, tie them down
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your parked car
I am holidays
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the leaves
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all wrong
It's all right
It's all wrong
It's all right
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the once who'll spit at you
You'll be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Oh, it's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had
The best thing you have had is gone away
D-don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
I don't want to be your friend
I just want to be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial
The infrastructure will collapse
Voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband goodnight
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
Weird fishes
Get towed by the worms
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As the magic disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again
The walls abandon shape
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the noise
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you start unraveling
Before you take my mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaws falling into place
There is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
Jigsaws falling into place
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
There there
Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely?
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me?
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Reckoner
Take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings
[Backing vocals]
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be oh me
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all can
But now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
When I see you messing me around?
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create
But when I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want
Now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know, I don't want to know, I don't want to know
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to fill your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and we'll be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird lights float into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
There'll be something missing
And now that you found it
It's gone
Now you feel it you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to Hell
For what your
Dirty mind is thinking
Karma police
Arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
When it comes it's so, so, disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down
Let down
Let down
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, falling
Bouncing back and one day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction (you know where you are)
Hysterical and useless (you know where you are)
Hysterical and (you know where you are)
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
Wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living,
I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And in your life, there comes the darkness
This spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Now we're trapped, we're dark cloud's people
We are helpless to resist
In your darkest hour
But it was just a lie, just a lie
Just a lie, just a lie
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
Still turning heads, you know where it's at
This dread still covers us
You gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, and it's dark now
It was just a laugh, it was just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
Split infinite
And in your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
In your darkest hour
If you had another one
If you had another name
So dark
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because you're not there
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Yeah I feel it, I needed attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Yeah I need it, I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention
I needed attention
Yeah I love it, the attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Soon oh
I try to sing along
But the music's all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I'll swallow up flies?
Back and hide
But I'm not
Oh hail to the thief
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the box
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera
Facts for whatever
Fifteen steps
Then a shear drop
Please could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height
Rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
Come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
From a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)
God loves his childrean
God loves his children, yeah
Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
And it's too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh
Make a sound
Move back home
Pale imitation
With the edges
Sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
I'm trapped in this body and can't get out
Oh, oh
Has the light gone out for you?
'Cause the light's gone for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
You can fight it like a dog
And they brought me to my knees
They got scared and they put me in
They got scared and they put me in
All the lies run around my face
All the lies run around my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
I'm alive
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
Oh Maria, come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient, patiently
I didn't care but now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging around for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, whoa
Say, hey
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
Do it to yourself
Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green
You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you after it's too late
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
This dance
This dance
Is like a weapon
Is like a weapon
Of self defense
Of self defense
Against the present
Against the present
The present tense
I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'll be dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around at the penny drop
Won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
I stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Or all this love
Has been in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I'm lost, I'm a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
These rumors and suspicion
Anger is a poison
The only truth that I can see
Is when you put your lips to these
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs
Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me
I want to, I want to be someone else or I'll explode.
Floating upon the surface for the birds?, the birds?, the birds?
You want me, well fucking come and find me.
I'll be waiting, with a gun and a pack of sandwiches and nothing, nothing, nothing.
Nothing.
You want me, well come on and break the door down.
You want me, fucking come on and break the door down.
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Who's in a bunker, who's in a bunker?
Women and children first and the children first and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow till I burst
Until I burst until I
Who's in a bunker who's in a bunker?
I have seen too much I haven't seen enough
You haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first and the children first and the children
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time
Ice age coming ice age coming
Let me hear both sides let me hear both sides let me hear both
Ice age coming ice age coming
Throw it in the fire throw it in the fire throw it on the
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
We're not scaremongering
This is really happening happening
Mobiles squearking mobiles chirping
Take the money run take the money run take the money
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
Here I'm alive (the first of the children)
Everything all of the time (the first of the children)
(The first of the children)
Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
Their faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great job, no message coming in
And you're so small
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
The path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
And the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
I feel this often, go
I feel this often, go
It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
But you can take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up (all the good times)
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
All the good times
Take me back again
Take me back
Take me back again
Oh
You really me
Really mess
Ah
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up
You really messed up this time (ah)
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
In my spirit white
Totally alive
In my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didn't know
Totally alive
Totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Kid A, kid A
Kid A, kid A
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking on a lemon
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place
There are two colors in my head
There are two colors in my head
What is that you tried to say
What is was you tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Everything
Everything
Everything
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely
And they pray
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon, expending
And all you have to do is say yeah
All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down too deep lonely
And they pray
Honey, come to me before it's too late
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon, expelling
And all you have to do is say yeah
One two three four
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like domino's
In pretty patterns
Fingers in the blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
Take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to
What you ought to
An elephant thats in the room is
Tumbling tumbling tumbling
In duplicate and duplicate
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
Guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough is enough is enough
I love you but enough is enough, enough
A last stop
There's no real reason
Been thinking about you, your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?
All the things you got,
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes,
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
Why should you care when I'm not there?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Should I still love you, still see you in bed
When I'm playing with myself?
What do you care when I'm not there?
All the things you got
That you'll never need
All the things you got
I'm played out and bleed to please you
Been thinking about you
I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me and I want more
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of Police or Vice Chancellor
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison and now I want more
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison
Wake
From your sleep
The drying of
Your tears
Today
We escape
We escape
Pack
And get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before
All hell
Breaks loose
Breathe
Keep breathing
Don't loose
Your nerve
Breathe
Keep breathing
I can't do this
Alone
Sing
Us a song
A song to keep
Us warm
There's
Such a chill
Such a chill
You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your
Rules and wisdom choke you
Now
We are one
In everlasting peace
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope
That you choke
That you choke
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why
I'm moving out of orbit
(Turning in somersaults)
Turning in somersaults
(A giant turtle's eyes)
A giant turtle's eyes
(And jellyfish float by)
And jellyfish float by
(It's what keeps me alive)
That there
That's not me
I go
Where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah it's gone
And I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here
I'm not here
Bloom
Open your mouth wide
The universe will sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with whys
I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults
A giant turtle's eyes
As jellyfish float by
Morning Mr. Magpie
You got some nerve coming here
You got some nerve coming here
You stole it all
Give it back
You stole it all
Give it back
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
And took my memory
You know you should
But you don't
You know you should
But you don't
Good morning Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now you've stolen all the magic
Took my melody
Little By Little
Turned so nasty now
The dark's there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease and you're such a flirt
Once you've been around you've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
You could want it all, the flag and pole
I'm curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that's killing you
Killing you
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I don't know where it is I should look
Little by little by hook or by crook
I am such a tease, and you're such a flirt

Lotus Flower
I would shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I would shrink and I would disappear
I would slip into the groove
And cut me up
And cut me up
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We would shrink and then be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I'll set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird that's flown into my room
Slowly we unfold
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast-ballooning head
Listen to your heart
Codex
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Flying to our side
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
Give Up The Ghost
Don't haunt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lust and soul
In your arms
Gather up the pitiful
In your arms
What seems impossible
In your arms
I think I have had my fill
In your arms
I think I should give up the ghost
In your arms
Separator
it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
the sweetest flowers and fruits were hanging from the trees
falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
it's like i've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
I've my heart in my mouth
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the Beholder
I'm a fish now, out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I fell open, I lay under
At the tea parlour
I lost your number
And once it's over
Hid back under
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
If you think this is over, then you're wrong
It's like I've fallen out of bed from a long and vivid dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
Wake me up
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out the bottle
Funny ha ha funny how
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
When the walls bend
When the walls bend
With your breathing
With your breathing
With your breathing
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
They will suck you down
To the other side
To the shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red
Shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells
Your alarm bells
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
They should be ringing
This is the gloaming
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it but it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen from my life support
My iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are loosing it, can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch and we are grateful for our
Iron lung
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out we'll just hum
This this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
If you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's okay
Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can?
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
If you try the best you can
If you try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionettes
Floating around on a prison ship
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah (oh oh oh)
Ah ah ah
Oh oh oh
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
And you can't offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Believe, believe, believe, believe
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
You are the sun the moon and stars
Are you and I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you
It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Yeah
You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
(4, 5, 6, 7)
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch and not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
And there'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I'm on a roll
I'm on a roll this time
I feel my luck could change
Kill me, Sarah
Kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The head of state has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knives you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the tax man
Let me back
Let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror at the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
Walking like giant cranes
And with my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world
And are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers
Investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers city
Boys in first class don't know we're born just know
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over
Get up get over and turn the tape off
I keep the wolf from the door
But he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again if I squeal to the cops
They love me like I was their brother
They protect me
Listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine
Made me happy
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
I call up my friend the good angel
But she's out with
Her answer-phone
She says she'd love to come help but
The sea would
Electrocute us all
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Nice dream, if you think that you're strong enough
Nice dream, if you think you belong enough
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
Now come home
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said,
I been where I liked
I slept with who I liked
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating
Like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used as a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I don't know why I feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and salivate
Like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you
Should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart arse
But we all like stars
That wasn't my intention
I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up
Is the new up
Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?
Your services
Are not required
Your future's bleak
You're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen
Without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate
I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
All on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on
Pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapse on us
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no-one drives
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
So glad, so glad you're mine
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think
I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think
Start again begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never go back
Never go back
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Come back
Come back
Ah, ah
Ah
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my mouth
I'm not coming back
So knives out
Cut him up
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth
If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my mouth
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
So knives out
Cut him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I want you to know
He's not coming back
His blood is frozen
Still there is no point letting it go to waste
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
Fade out again
Fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Rows and rows of enemies
I'd love to set you free
I bet you really miss me
This is a foul tasting medicine
This is a foul tasting medicine
You really messed up this time
You just ain't got the message yet
Still trapped in your full stop
You messed up everything
The truth will mess you up
The good times
Take me back home again
Take me back home again
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking
This slow
My baby's got the bends
Oh, no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the C.I.A
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky-high
Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would-
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
When I need you
Slight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You've done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear
And innocent
The water's clear
And innocent
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floatin' upon this surface for the birds
The birds
The birds
You want me?
Fuckin' well, come and find me
I'll be waitin'
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothin'
Nothin'
Nothin'
You want me?
Well, come and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready,
I'm ready
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
What seems impossible (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
In your arms (don't hurt me)
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen
To my children
Meet the real-world coming
Out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
Rise up
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Little baby's eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes
In the next world war
In a jack knifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Fitter, happier
More productive
Comfortable
Not drinking too much
Regular exercise at the gym, three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well, no more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car, baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals, never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends, enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank, hole in wall
Favours for favours, fond but not in love
Charity standing orders on sundays, ring-road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows, nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace, slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of societ, pragmatism not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet, shot of baby strapped in backseat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
That's driven into
Frozen winter shit, the ability to laugh at weakness
Calm, fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna a perfect body
I wanna a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.
She's running out again,
She's running out
She's run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
You don't wanna talk to me,
You don't wanna say the words,
You try to get off the hook,
You try to get off the hook.
Sprawling on a pin,
Hanging off the hook,
Trying to get yourself away,
Trying to get yourself away.
There's no use dwelling on,
On what might have been,
Just think of all the fun,
You could be having.
We know the way you talk,
We know what you want,
We know what you want,
What you really wanted.
Take a look around,
There's candles on the cake,
On what might have been,
The road you should have took,
Mistakes mistaken
There's no use dwelling on,
No use dwelling on.
It's such a beautiful day,
It's such a beautiful day,
Find yourself a ????,
Go and get some rest.
It's such a beautiful day.
It's such a beautiful day.
Go up to the mic,
Go up to the mic,
Go and get some rest.
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement
Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets
They're all
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Oh
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be alright
Alright
I'm alright
Alright
I'm just
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
Wish that I could come out of the fog
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
in a bunch of flowers
you just say the word, apparition comes
with a long and winning handsome smile
wish we could connect
Step into the fog
of the diving board
blend into the light
down the cable lines
roll onto the earth
reforming on the wind
two places at once
taste the air with you
undo all the ties
wish that I could flip one of those lies
lift us on the wind
see that stretchy smile
go
Right across your
Face
Cut a hole (2x)
a hole (2x).
