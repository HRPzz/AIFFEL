Hey ho how ya doing, where ya been?
Probably doing ho stuff cause there you ho again

Feline, feminine, fantastical, women
Not all, just some

With ugly chicks faces

While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands

Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon

Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes

Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy (Luda)
How low can you go?(x8) (Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) Hahaha Luda! (Luda) [Verse 1]
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of yo booty jigglin' out yo'jeans
Baby pull yo'pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
BUT, how low can you go
Lower than yo' mamas ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would of imagined it
Not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doin' it on the dance floor
Mad 'cuz I can't get with you
Just show me how to dance (OOOH)
I may not want to get low
So I'm post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib then
I might show you girls a thang or 2
Yeah I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus]
(Squeaky Voice)
How low can you go?(x8) (Shawnna)
I could go low, (go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know,
Go low,(go low) lower than you know, (Luda) [Verse 2]
I be like knick knack paddy wack
Oh where my kitty cat give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'till I get to the center
And let a reala nigga take you home
I can make this show stop
As soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to yo' drop
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really gettin low,
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on T.V.
'Cuz I like that French vanilla and the caramel
BUT, when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them Puerto Rican pecan
Peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces
'Cuz I think you a superstar
With a ass like that you gotta blew
Before you make it big well there's just one thing that I gotta know [Chorus] (Luda) [Verse 3]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop (get it get it)
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me what you working with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah you a superstar
There's just a thing I gotta know
So... [Chorus] Yeah, Welcome to Atlanta, jack and hammer and vogues'
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it?
I would happen to know, the one with the flow
Who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork
Only siguar needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon
The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Cadallacin' the truck

What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Oh a sauna, ja'causezi
In the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off of her feet (chorus) I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up on alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around
Georgia brown
That's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, over worked, under paid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Baby your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team off the rope
On the ocean or in the boat
Factories, or a hunred spokes
What 'bout in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little bootie up with my belt
Scream help
Play my game
Dracula n I'll get my fangs
Horse back I'll get my reigns
School teacher let me get my grades (chorus) x4 Heads up! Heads up!

Disturbin tha Peace Georgia, Georgia, Georgia, Georgia [Chorus: x2]
We on the grind in, Georgia
All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit
That's why I keep my Georgia tech in the state of - Georgia [Chorus: x2] I'm from the home of neckbones , blackeyed peas,
Turnip and collard greens we
The children on the corn dirtier than Bob Marley's pee pee,
G.A the peach state where we stay,
My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Now I was born in the belly of the bottom of the map,
Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,
Country as hell, they some warriors, told sum to spray SumthAn the same shape as Florida,
Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,
I got a Chevrolet on 26's,
I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia [Chorus: x2] Georgia , Georgia , Georgia , Georgia - Georgia How low can you go? How low can you go?

Face down, ass up!
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans,
Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when I see you do it,
Better then I ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama's ever seen it in her life time,
Never would've imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause I can't get wit chick ya just show me how to dance (Oh!)
I may not wanna get low so I post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then I might show you girls a thang or two,
Yea I think you a superstar wit' a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
There's just one thing that I gotta know How low can you go? How low can you go?

Till I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home,
I could make me show stop,
Soon as you hear this flow pop,
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your block,
Put the needle on a record and I make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin' low then I'm a shoot a video and put it all on T-V,
Cause I like that French vanilla and the caramel,
But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
No discrimination,
I love how they seem to please us,
I wanna taste them butterican pican peanut buttercups like Reese's Pieces,
Cause I think you a superstar,
With a ass like that you gotta blow,
Before you make it big,
Well there just one thing I gotta know How low can you go? How low can you go?

Runaway love Now little Lisa is only nine years old
Shes tryin' to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone, and they never met her family
Mama's always gone, and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin' and nobody will listen
Mama on drugs, gettin' high up in the kitchen
Bringin' home men at different hours of the night
Startin' with some laughs, usually endin' in a fight
Sneak into her room while her mama's knocked out
Tryin' to have his way and little Lisa says 'ouch'
She tries to resist, but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom, but her mama don't believe her
Lisa is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love

Runaway love Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty, and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic step dad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions; she makin' up excuses
Bleedin' on the inside, cryin' on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she about
Her name is lil' Stacy, and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight till the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back Runaway love

Runaway love Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin' to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops Ex to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin' sex with a boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep, and she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection; he's usin' no glove
Never thinkin' 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin' for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by, and her belly gets big
The father bails out; he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin' her mama will blow it all outta proportion
Plus she lives poor, so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in the world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin' else to do but get her clothes and pack
She say she's about to run away and never come back Runaway love

How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please
In the back, on the block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where they pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night creep, creep
I'll see you later we'll be in them streets I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky

Just seen a big ol' ass, (it's Saturday)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky
Sticky, icky, icky, icky I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

She makes her own money, pays her own bills, always stat fly, keeps it so real,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl behind closed doors she a nasty girl.
She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass, walks so proper, talks with such class,
But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl. I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet
Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet
Shoes so sexy, body so hot
Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop
Legs so smooth, clothes so tight
Style so sexy, make her just right
Never too much, never too little
Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle
Eyes so innocent, smile so bright
Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night
All for a man, all 'cause she bought it
All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it
Product of her birth place, know about the streets
Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets
Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread
Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed [Chorus] I got a college girl go to church every Sunday
Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me
But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy
One thing about her she get her own money
Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry
Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny
Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman
Sex all night, go to work every mornin'
Text me from work and told me she was horny
Text her back and told her me too mommy
When you get off work daddy gon' punish
You're my nasty girl forever I promise [Chorus] I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon
She plays like my house is her emergency room
Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa
Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta
All white coat, all white heels
And nothin' underneath so its an all night deal
I'm a number one patient and delighted to be
And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D
But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild
And every single night she wanna take me to trial
She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof
So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth
Cause I'm hung like a jury
Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry
You may proceed, let the games begin
And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again [Chorus] I came to party like tonight will never end
Let's party again
Let's party again

You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around from me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinda shits he on
You disappear like "poof, bitch be gone"
You think twelve gon' catch me, gimmie a break

It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears

Sheep skin on the rug, +golden grain+ on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride

Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the petal to the floor, radar in the grille
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
Nos tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so f what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun You just got hustled for a wire of cash

Boy whatcha gon' do? act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me what I'm gon' do? act a fool I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off ramp doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin' through east pernium, on way to ben heel
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin shit

Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez, that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil john cue and get a +change of heart+

Stand up! Stand up! If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey yeah I'm on a roll
Sometimes I gotta close my eyes just to open my soul
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher 'bout to break some rules That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, for the rest of my life If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol" That's somewhere to go, but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke, a lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey, oh
Na na hey If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time
'Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
And you can call me crazy, but I like to roll the dice
So I'm willing to bet that I'mma be crazy for the rest of my life For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life Chorus: (2x)
I hate it when it's too many niggas
Not enough hoes
Too many rookies
Not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all yall can suck my dick I got em whip like miracle
Ludacris lyrical fool
We dirty south
Shut yo mouth
We rock jewels
No holds barred
But obey the block rules
Cock tools put chlorine in record pools
Are there anymore like ya
Hell nah
I treat humans like students
Fail yall
So turn your books to page 69 and start sucking
When organize drop the track and start ducking
When Ludacris get in the bed then start fucking
You wanna be starting somethin
Get out the booth and let me tell yall the truth
We kick down doors
Save all the h20 for front rows
Live in the bank and watch what stank hoes
Stay chromed out
And thats on or off road
If you know what I mean
Proceed to stay clean
Light skinned nigga turned red but get green
Inhale some of that dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans Chorus (2x) Boy you done lost yo mind
Nah I lost my virginity
And I shot quick like that fool that shot Kennedy
Whats the remedy
Henessy coke
If you cut all yo money you still be half broke
Ashes to ashes
Smoke or get smoked
We come by the masses you come and get choked
Take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired of fast food so they cooked up dope
So now we eating lobster shrimp and thangs
And watch for imposters thats been in the game
We invented the game
And yall just got hipped
Man what that smell
Probably you're upper lip
Cause I love to walk around like my shit don't stank
Even if its cigars in that purple colored dank
Filling in the Gump wit no track of Tom Hanks
Go put this in your jaw like weeners and beef franks Chorus (2x) I put too much sugar in my Kool Aid
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I'd like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I'd like to get laid
Right up on my back like rugs and floor mats
I'm on the right page but what's my format
I wave to the ocean cause I'm where shores at
And women go nuts just like my bosack
Did you know that
Man I'm the gift of change
Electric stove so give me the keys to the Range
Shagadelic beautiful but strange
Went to Magic City saw Nikki in blew flames
Rearrange
Same braud different night
Pass the E&J; and let a nigga get right
The bomb threaten'd dude that's on your same flight
The highlights that I neva high ass light Chorus (2x) Cadillac grills, Cadillac mill's
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
Twenty inch, wide, twenty inches high
Hoe don't you like my twenty inch, ride
Twenty inch thighs make twenty inch, eyes
Hoping for American twenty inch, pies
Pretty ass, clothes, pretty ass, toes
Oh how I love these pretty ass, hoes
Pretty ass high class anything, goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty ass 'bows
Long-john drawers, long-john stalls
Any stank puss' make my long john, pause
Women on they cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's, balls All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes
When ya get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows) Dirty South mind blowing Dirty South bread
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South girls gimme Dirty South head
Hand me down flip-flops, hand me down socks
Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth, cold
And rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth, told
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the third degree
And if you sweat in your sleep then you sweat from me All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes
When ya get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows) Hit by, stars, hit by, cars
Drunk off the liquor getting hit by, bars
Keep yo' girl close cause she's hit by, far
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars
Afro, picks, afro, chicks
I let my "Soul Glow" from my afro, dick
Rabbit out the hat pulling afro, tricks
Afro-american afro, thick
Overall country, overall jeans
Overall Georgia, we overall clean
"Southern Hospitality" or overall mean
Overall triple, overall beams
Thugged out niggas wear thugged out, chains
Thugged out blocks playing thugged out, games
All black tinted up thugged out, Range

And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)

And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes

You know who we are, cause we pimping all over the world [Ludacris]
Sing it hoes,
All over the world baby, it's only right that I share my experiences with y'all,
Cause I've been places where you'll never imagine, but I'ma start at home,
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh), Hey girl how ya doing,
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin,
I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name,
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange, Hey!
See I'm the man of this town,
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around,
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinking of me,
We got people to meet and many places to see, Hey!
I'm really digging ya lips,
But be careful where you walking when you swinging them hips,
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causing a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausing so fast, Hey!
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it,
I like ya hair and every style that ya wear it,
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes,
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes [Chorus] [Ludacris]
You hear the song so dance,
Don't always think I'm trying to get in your pants,
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3-D,
I'm taking you places you only see on T.V.,
Trying to show ya that living is trife,
How many guys you know that can bring the travel channel to life,
One day we on the auto-bind swerving driving,
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands,
If you with me ain't no time to sleep,
Especially at wet willies on Miami Beach,
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If I make it to Atlanta's Brina Brothers convention,
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours,
Making sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard,
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see,
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me, Hey! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade,
Than at night I'm in New Orleans drinking hand Grenades,
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest,
In Mardi Gras all the women trying to show more They chest,
Hey I'm in Jamaica spending massive bucks,
While the ladies all begging me to masha tucks,
I had sad Beginnings when I rap wit no fans,
Now it's all happy endings in my lap in Japan, Hey
I used to think that it was way too cold
Til I went to Canada and say some beautiful hoes,
Now I Hit the Caribbean every year in Toronto,
Then fly t Illinois to get a taste of Chicago,
Oh Yet and still you wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil,
Ain't no need of even asking Brah,
The best women are reside in Africa, and that's real [Chorus] [Ludacris]
City Hoes [$Money Mike$]

Ludacris, Disturbin' Tha Peace family. Recognize royalty
When you hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this
Nigga's earring, Luda throw some grapes on these bitches! These bitches throwing rose petals at my feet man!
They want to spoil me, treating me like royalty,
What I'm supposed to do? It's such a sweet thing
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L, if you disagree
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testing me is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than yo' father hairline
It's Ludacris, I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
I'm fly, even when I get high I work cash
And even got my coats bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees, and I'm here to teach the principle
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man.

You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And coming up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers, four wives and three amigos
I go scuba diving in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinned version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they called me bingo
Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more bullets than yo' Billboard singles Ho that is just too much! You just gotta give applause

S.g.!
Chris breezy (it's me) [Chorus]
I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls
I know I know what them girls like [Bridge: Sean Garrett]
I know what they feel
Cause I'm breathing on the hills
And it's me they wanna kill
Cause I give her what them girls like [Chorus] [Bridge] [Verse 1: Ludacris]
Relax and take notes,
While I'm put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect, then if I put you up on cane,
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whisky double,
Because the girls of the world ain't nothing but trouble,
They like a little danger and might not admit it,
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it,
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowing with swag!
And keeps his women all draped in new louis vuitton bags!
With Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to 'em,
I like open toe straps, but sg talk to em! [Sean Garrett]
I gotta whole bunch of girls I'm tryin' to bring by their kryptonite,
Betta wear your cake, cause they bringing that kryptonite, [Chorus] [Bridge] [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I know what you like baby! [Bridge] [Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yea, we gonna take this to verse 2,
Now some of em wanna family, a sense of security,
Necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelery,
So, shop till you drop, or till it makes you psychotic,
Here's a triple black card, it ain't tricking if you got it!
Others will stay content if you just making 'em laugh,
Send 'em to the spa, get a massage then bubble bath,
So later on, they can dance and throw a drink in they hand,
And try any and everything they never did with they man, me!
So get loose and slide off your damn garments,
Show 'em whose the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm trying to find,
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind,
And I got plenty more to learn if you's invested in me,
They don't love me for who I am but who I'm destined to be,
And for that!, I'll give you everything up under the sun,
Cause in the end, all the girls just wanna have fun! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
I know what you feel yes! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
If you cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit!
I say,
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen!
So if you cant take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen!
Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick,
Gets that ride or die pudding for that ride or die shit! [Chorus] [Bridge] They wanna go on vacation! I know it!
Lets go! [Chorus] [Bridge] [Ludacris]
Yes! they want what they can! [Ludacris]
Women,
I love y'all, there's not enough time.
Believe that, and if your man don't tell you every day how beautiful you are,
I'm letting ya know right damn now,
You are beautiful baby!
I love women so much, I have one,
Luda!
Chris breezy, this too easy,
Sg what up! [Chorus: x2 Ludacris & DMX]
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (bet a stack)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is) [Ludacris]
Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they see-note stacks
Busting dominoes, spades, Cee-lo, craps
We shooting pool at the Luda-plex, I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools want to do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you want to do
But come up short and oh the things that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm making 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase, scared money don't make none! [Chorus] [Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gambling problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
Drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowing steam
Counting green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
All my people bring the strength to the block
Yes sir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's goin' do it
It's people living they life coming up off change
And hustlers paying they bills coming up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate, catch me out in A.C.
Calling yo' bluff with Puff eating cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers [Chorus] [Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breaking the whole casino and doing back-flips, man
Cameras eying us, sidebetters trying us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buying us
Trying to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breaking 'em, and dice still shaking 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em [Chorus: x2] It's 2 am in the morning and it...uhhh...light showers

Automatic thickness for eight
You'll soon get it
Just stay workin' hard at it
Goodness gracious
Good God almighty
You got a badoonka donk
Girl don't hurt nobody
Toes all painted, feet all out
It's an aphrodisiac for
The mall without a doubt
Juicy chunky stanky funky
Gut slappin' ball slappin' cater
To your every fantasy
You got your tongue clitoris tits
And belly pierced
(All that?)
Necklace around yo' waist
Toe rings, girl do yo' thang

(B**** you know the name)
Whoo-wee Jesus
JoJo K-Ci and Mary
Girl you don't know

(Lord have mercy)
Ain't no doubt about it
When she walk by
Tongues hang out
Eyes pop out the socket
(Bing)
Cats cringe and point like pssh
Ummph you can see that
Thang from the front
We gas those up like
Full service
And, keep 'em drunk
Like Kathie Lee Curtis
And when you shake it
You rock my world
I done died and
Went to heaven
You got a fatty girl [Chorus:] Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Hi-tec boots spray painted witcha names
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
Thick herringbone chain, one gold with yo' initial
Harris Photos, group shots, can you remember?
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed, had North Clayton crazed
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' the invasions of haters, man crews from all around
Used to get down at True Flavas, bumpin Key Lo
Rockin Damage, Cross Colour and Paco
While playboys stepped in talent shows
Prom night, tux and Kangol was so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school) We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before they started jackin' jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark, Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin'
Double dare ya touch shorty on the ass, that's a bet
Want your Kool-Aid and sugar, smack your hands and say "sweat"
It's mine now place it in my Louis Vuitton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slouch socks, box Chevy Caprice
Hot Niss, cut da whole Disturbin' Tha Peace
Wit no conscience, broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin' homage to College Park We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With two sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin' all that got damn noise, man We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids We were tryin' so hard
Hard to survive
'Cause even though we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids Yeah, we goin' send this one out
To everybody that put mo' into they cars than they do they relationship
Let's ride Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! Yes, 7 cars, 8 cribs and ain't a damn thing changed
I'm still pumping 10 kickers, still gripping the grain
Still candy in the paint, still riding them things
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, "Gimme a break!"
It's a pity how we turn our city into obstacle courses
Don't be mad cause I can't hold my 500 horses
Lamborghini's and Porsche's, Ferrari's and Vipers
I'ma wipe the seats with you drool then rub the hood with a diaper
Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seat-belts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up
Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
Time to play or better yet it's time to bring out them toys

Even if I just put a fresh coat of wax on I'm making sure the slippers is clean
The 26's is mean, shut down the block, nigga picture the fiends
My system supreme, you can feel the knock, just picture the scene
The chickens just scream, whole crew balling they sick of my team
We getting the cream, I'm through hollering, I'm living my dream
I'm black with a scheme, won't stop until that fat lady sings
And yeah it's actual and factual what my faculty brings
A car show for whatever we slide and wherever we glide
You can keep your rules and regulations man cause we don't abide
And we looking alive, Mercedes Benz, 6 or the 5
In a Beamer, Lexus or Ac', we don't know how to act when we drive
And I fiend for the ride, I lay back and lean to the side
Onlookers and turning heads is all that's seen through his eyes
I'm breezing on by, and no doubt, it's easy to fly
But it's even better when you slow down or ease to the side
And go Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]
[Luda] It's get out, put my pedal to the flow and let's roll! I'm riding up in, GTO's, and fo'-fo'-two's
Grand Prix's, S-S's cause we so so cool
Riding Regal's or the 'llacs, we in Chevelle's and Vert's
Skylarks, motorcycles, ATV's with the works
Malibu's and Camaro's, T-Birds and Novas
Escalade's, Navigators, Expeditions and Rovers
H-2's and Denali's, pickup trucks with the beams
Crown Vics, Monte Carlos, even Cutlass Supreme's
Are going Two miles an hour, so everybody sees you [Repeat: x3]

Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhoo

Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl Ludacris
Listen can't get you off my mind
Even if I tried
You're my life
Cross my heart and hope to die
Don't care what people thinking
Don't care what people say
Well make it last for ever
And then make them people pay
Cause all they do is doubt us
But they don't understand
That you're my only women
And I'm your only man
Lets fly away and go somewhere where its 81 degrees
Then jump up on a yacht and sail the 7 seas
Ill climb the highest mountains just to kiss your face
Then put some spice up in your life just to get a taste
Don't nothing feel wrong I'm still gone
And your tip toeing through my mind with your heals on (Get it girl) Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind

Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl Ludacris
My baby girl and I promise for you I'll do whatever
And I can think of many things that we can do together
Lets go shopping Cause a woman needs options and diamonds and pearls
Then go eat at the finest restaurants around the world
Drink from the finest grapes smoke from the finest leaves
Draped in the finest clothes I wanna put your mind at ease
A full body massage and then let's go catch a movie
Ahh fuck it lets go home and make a movie
Before we can hit the park go find a quiet spot
Then I'll make my body move until your body stops
Cause you know that special spot
It ain't that hard to find
Plus you've been pacing through my mind all the time Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind
I think about you all the time, all the time, all the time
Girl I cant get my mind off youoowhooo
I cant get my mind off you youowhooo
I cant get my mind off youowhooo
Girl its you no one but you
Cause You're my baby girl Damien Marley's Verse
Now baby love you eva prep
And full of class when you a step
Soft supple and delicate
Bumper firm and heavy set
Every muckle a mickle make
Giggle, chuckle, every breath
Every freckle spot, every speck, I say, I say
Your performance commands respect
And buckle dance than you expect
Nothing lesser than the best
And I'm a loving intellect
Cause I've thought out every step
Every building must erect
Nothing must be incorrect
Nutten mussin get neglect
Could separation separate
That would be inappropriate
There can be no surrogate
For the loving that I get
My cerebellum will not let
Nor allow me to forget
Eva since the day we met
SUGA!! Chorus
I love it when you cross my mind, my mind, my mind

Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that, so back that
No wonder why you wakin' up up swollen I'm feelin' you Luda', smokin' my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
On the back and leave it drippin' down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magilla-cutty, chasin' booty soft as silly putty

From slow pokin' to locomotion, hittin' bunnies, for threesomes getcha buddy
When I'm feelin' scummy I love to cut, 10-4 Thick skin so, butter soft I'm rippin' the buttons off yo' blouse

We can get the mattress goin' 'eh-err, eh-err'
Handlin' business while I bang bang, skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen floor or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
And the flesh in the West is the best
But Twista love them Chicago and South hoes Come up out yo' negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times, but it's seven today
Ludacris in the back of your Chevrolet
Ahh, ahh! What's my name?

It's killin' me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin', up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin' wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin' slapped up I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head

But I got the radio bumpin' Jagged Edge by the bed

Come on and dip off through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do get ya purse and get together

If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
If men sleep around we some players but for women
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho Now I be riding in my Bentley coupe stuntin' with the top down
Four twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go
You prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
I put my fist up, I got the power girl
I wash my nuts off, go take a shower girl
It's been an hour girl, it's time to go
And if my neighbor see you while you walking out my door (hey ho)
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho
They be saying hey ho [Chorus] Can't nobody do it like Kim
Only women that can do it like men
V-V-S is be them gems
(Ho, now count that)
My money coming in
Bringing them corners on them rims
So play the check book tell me how do you bounce that
I bounce into position like I am vinegar Kama Sutra
But money make me come, go and ask Luda'
And women cheat better than men we don't disturb them
My motto is "what they don't know won't hurt them"
We just do it like you do, see the roles done switched
If I'm a ho you's a ho, if I'm a bitch you's a bitch
Know that I'ma stay rich so fella's do what you do
Cause you don't fuck us niggas we fuck you [Chorus] (Hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho) If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying
(Hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
Now we saying (hey ho)
If men sleep around we some players but for women they be saying She likes the night lights, brights lights, big spending
Lil Fate been big pimpin', pimpin'
So don't be mad at my raps and try and look at me funny
Cause you know that most you ladies trading sex for money
So if you coming out the pocket then you might get laid
That's how the rent car no the cell phone get paid
I bet the snakes all show once you cut that grass
And I'm a pimp so it's time that I exploit they ass
You see it's hoes after the party it's hoes after the show
It's hoes up in the lobby, it's hoes out on the stroll
Here's some no dough, no dough, no sleep
Ho on your feet, if you don't work you don't eat [Chorus] [Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout "that's supposed to be you, girl" [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need [Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me [Young Jeezy:]
On 285, I don't know where I'm goin' on 285, I drink when I drive
I just love when I'm high, I don't know here I'm goin', on 285, on 285, on 285 [x2] [Ludacris:]
I come equipped with 2 straps on my lap move back 45 tucked by my side
Sip a little bit of this, sip that drink up I'm so drunk when I drive.
I'm wood grain, grippin' 'n tippin' on some 24's.
I puff the magic dragon & then blow smoke out of my nose
I try to tell em ain't nothin' change but the mileage on the range
It's baby powder white an I whip it like cocaine
All up an down 285 an I'm goin' around in circles man
My partners call me prince cause they know I got that purple rain
Burners along my waist belt, gotta put up my pants like I'm urkel man
My girlfriend said u sure I said bitch I'm for certain man
I'm hurtin' the game so bad they can't keep up when I count this skrilla
My momma quit her job cause I got her workin' with six figures
Yes she's workin' with six figures 'n niggas is workin' like some slaves
She retired a little bit early because her son is fukin paid
And she ain't gotta do shit but be rich an stay alive
And once in awhile just take her Lexus an drive on 285 [Chorus x 2]
I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
I feel like slappin' a nigga today (slap, slap)
Slappin' a nigga today
Slappin' a nigga today This morning I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work; I'm tired
I hate my nine to five
And I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today
Killin' my boss today
I'm thinking 'bout killin' my boss today (it's just a thought, man)
Killin' my boss today (yeah) Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking, why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking, why did you take him away? (Why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (Hey) I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
'Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today
I'm thinking 'bout robbin' a bank today
Robbin' a bank today (real talk) Baby mama's at home and fussin' (fussin')
Callin' up my mobile, cussin' (cussin')
Always yappin' about this and that
But she really don't be talkin' 'bout nothin'
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it) [Chorus: x2] Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my forty-five
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away (hey) Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away
Wasting my time away?
Is it 'cause I'm wasting my time away (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it) My grand mama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
'Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (Don't say nothin')
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo) Troops gone, and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
'Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today
(Live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey) [Chorus: x4] Yo hello, Luda

Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got the hook up
You know what I did
Who'd ever thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whipping yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in the sand, y'all lay in the snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider [Chorus] Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took that
World of Ghetto fabulous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Be careful what you look at
cause you looking to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm getting nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party
while y'all hitting th bong
But y'all be hitting my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suckers didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull the gold actor
Get slapped up
Drove up the wall
Put it in Reverse
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if that's what I need
Filthy south and D's
That's why I roll in from the Southside breeze
Give it to me now [Chorus] Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from the couch to the toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
My Northside mackers got dis broads acting foolish
And do this for a living

Nightlife running dis streets, it sounds beautiful

Southside, I represent it till I'm dead

I be representin', representin' Luda, yeah you representin' for bad bitches all around the world

You done take it a whole another level of freakiness When you blow my mind
To the point where all these other women Kinda feelin' like you stole their shine
So I better come with it,
Ha, and I better come split it
And I admit that I'm feeling a little pressure, when you're telling me I better come get it

Body is so angelical, a rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to I'll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it's not that many
You give me that good and plenty And I walk around all day grinin'
My mind and body are gone
That JJ so so sublime
Throw it in the air and turn it to sunshine, you make me wanna call the crib
And say I'm never coming home, Luda! Why you sayin'

Watch how I put it down
I be representin', I be representin' (I'm representin')
I be representin' I be representin' (I'm representin')
Watch how I put it down When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go I done took all I could take from you
Need a little bit more than a break from you
Matter of fact fuck you, don't need you in my life
You done did so much wrong I hope you get it right
But not at my expense, I did all I could do
You just took me for granted, you thought I was a fool
When I did everything in my power to help and please you
But I don't know you no more, fuck it, I caught amnesia
Too many emotions I try to bury
But the higher I climb, the less weight I'm trying to carry
And niggas holdin' on for dear life, bringin' me drama
But I'm only responsible for my daughters Cai and Karma
Nigga you's a grown man, get yourself together
Forget about the past, now's a better time than never
Matter of fact, it's time to start making better decisions
So put your fires out, and stop burning 'Cris' bridges
You little bitches When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Yeah, this industry's full of bullshitters
And all this time you thought you had me fooled niggas
In my Ferrari, partner thought he saw a spaceship
'Cause I move in speed not to get caught up in this fake shit
Smiling in my face when I'm around y'all
But soon as I leave, niggas be prayin' on my down fall
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavors?
Or that people thought you were clever, but now they know you stupid?
And misery loves company now that you're going through it?
Somebody tell these rappers I worked hard in these Louis
So get out of here, you don't want no parts in this shit, do we?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
So while you contemplate making your first million
I'll be somewhere contemplating on making my first billion
And then, trillion When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go The biggest mistake we make as individuals
Is thinking everyone lives by the same principles
But when I talk by the same teachers or principals
For you to know it's not the money, it's the principle
So I can't expect you to know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Our issues are deep within, we can't just talk 'em out
Niggas is fighting inside, we can't just walk 'em out
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
As if you know what I'm talkin' 'bout When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go Did some movies and started missing this rap shit
Back to rap then starting missing them movies
Left these hoes to settle down with just one chick
Get with one chick started missing them groupies
Stop drinking for a year and I was all sober
Next year I got drunk and did it all over
Yesterday I quit smoking and swore I had enough
Till I smelt it in the club and had to take a puff
I got rich and learned life was a bitch
Now everybody's after all of my ends
(Get yo hand out my pocket!)
When I was broke all love from my folks
But nowadays I'm losing all of my friends, let the story begin The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Start exercising and winning got me a six pack
Was eating healthy and did away with the junk
Then I got lazy and started to wanna kick back
My six pack reverted back to a gut
When I'm at the crib I'm mad I'm not at the club lit
When I'm at the club I'm mad I'm not at the crib
I used to be out partying every damn night
Now sometimes I'd rather be with my kids
I got checks gained a lot of respect now everywhere I go they holla my name (Luda!)
But sometimes wish that I was disguised for peace of mind over fortune and fame
Guess what I'm really saying The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away Last year got the Ferrari that I always wanted
Drove it crazy got sick of it had to trade (Give me my Ac'!)
All my fans convinced me to grow my hair back
Grew it back then started missing my fade
I got hits start trippin' I wasn't underground
Got underground start trippin' I need hits (We outta here!)
When you down and people give you the runaround
But feels great to know who really gives a shit
You cut the grass and the snakes will show
And know your neighbor's fertilizer is fake (Don't let it fool ya!)
We always searching what we never had
Always ignoring what's in front of our face
We've been conditioned to think The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly The grass is always greener on the other side
Always searching for another high
The grass is always greener on the other side
Caterpillar to a butterfly Bye bye butterfly
Fly away
Bye bye butterfly
Fly away [Gucci mane]
Hey how you doin, Ms. Lady? You so fine with it
I know you handlin business, can I get your 5 minutes?
Dont be offended by me telling you you thick with it

Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?
Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?
Dont be offended when I tell you that youre very pretty
Wit all that shake, can a player get some fries with it?
s Gucci [Ludacris - Verse 1]
That waist got a swivel to it
But that ass a Cali earthquake jiggle to it
She a stallion, no horseshit
You could fit that bitchs booty on a forklift
Beep! Beep! Bitch back it up
I put my balls on the table, tell her rack em up
Vanilla bed sheets, chocolate laid one way
Sprinkle my nuts on top what a sundae, hey
Whipped cream cherry on top
And when I aint wit her, p-ssy on lock
Throw away the key, its a rap bitch!
Large shake and a Ludacris sandwich [Hook] [Gucci Mane]
Yo, mama turned out, she so popular
You suckers cant see her with binoculars
Shell suck your pocket dry like Dracula
Her last boyfriend bought her an Acura
Dont try to get all attached to her
She an alley-cat type that chickll scratch you up
Like Bel Biv DeVoe said, Shes dangerous
Her old man used to snort angel dust
So, dont be quick to judge, shorty bad as f-ck
Shes the type that drive back with the bricks for bucks
She had a ballplayer dude but she f-cked him up
He bankrupt, selling cars like an auctioner
Its Gucci [Hook] [Ludacris]
Ive got a sausage for them hot cakes
And I be f-ckin while you niggas out on hot dates
You all polite and open doors for her
While every night I put that blanket on the floor for her
These hoes be sprintin like its track n field
Because this supersize dick is their Happy Meal
So for an extra value woody
Put this Big Mac into that Quarter-Pound p-ssy, yes!
Its Ludacris Mr. Slay-A-Bitch
Unless that p-ssy is smelling like a Filet-O-Fish
Shoo Fly, ho! Kick the bucket
And niggas talking shit I bust em in their chicken nugget [Hook] When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me
When the liquor get up in me I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

These haters want my paper and the snakes is out to get me
So when I leave this bitch I'm taking everything with me
With my wrist glowing and my fist throwing
And my Lamborghini Aventador sneak it on the block
Been going and I been flowing I gotta say that Ludacris, a nigga never gonna stop
Hanging with women that's loving them drugs
Neighborhood call me the plug of the plug
Poppin' a pill and then jump in the tub
We buy out the bar, we buy out the club
Got a black, AMX, I left home, no Visa
Talk money, and my money, talk back, like Caesar
Mix soda, with the syrup, we be leaning like the Tower of Pisa
And if y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all either I'm a motherfuckin' beast (When the liquor get up in me)
Tell these niggas clear the streets (When the liquor get up in me)
I'll be all up in my zone (When the liquor get up in me)

Ah shit I'm talking 1 shot, 2 shots, 3 shots, 4
How many shots to hit the motherfucking floor
You sipping man, quit tripping man, stop acting like a ho
Waitress said another round? I said you already know You see I started from nothing and made it up outta the hood
Dollar and a dream and I made what I could
Fifty to a hundred, then a hundred to a grand
Then a grand to a milli, nigga really what's good
It's wood in the whip the wood like a wood shop
Neighbor's all think that I cook rocks
No peace in the streets
Really got me thinking ain't no such thing as a good cop
My neck froze and no ice steel
Flows, rappers just bite still
Platinum plaques, three Grammy's
I tell you I Made It like Mike Will
With coupes all on that freeway
Pockets on Gabby Sidibe
Got cake and women blowing like everyday is my b-day We be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)
Getting freaky in the Caddy (When the liquor get up in her) Get lit (Get lit)

Ah shit

Ah shit She dragging a mink coat, got Peter pissed, it's a pity
A titan like Tennessee but she chiefing like Kansas City
She love it when she get tipsy and strip to the core essentials
With her legs sprawled out like the Air Jordan symbol
She be twenty thousand feet in my apartment in the sky
Y'all hoes just drink and drive, my woman just drink and fly
She a lady in the street ain't nothing fake about her booty
She call me for special ops, I told her that's my Call of Duty She be getting mighty bold (When the liquor get up in her)
She be sliding down that pole (When the liquor get up in her)
She be shaking it for daddy (When the liquor get up in her)

Hold the line I got ya momma on 3-way,
Tell her Ludas got more records than the DJ,
Tell her she should blow me like candles on ya B-Day,
Cause I've signed more lines then she's passed on the freeway,

Precious like a artifact, Valuable like a quarterback,
Hannible like they call me jack, Fall back like a starter hat,
Nah did he thought of that,

I mean how did I think of that, Now like a rental bring it back,

Someone should throw me a surprise party for every line,
Every time I do what I do I do it dirty like swine for the dirty and fine hip hop I'm alive! I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what ya need, Weezy F,
The last ofa dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,
Say it with me (Mcs move the crowd) [Repeat x3] [Ludacris]
This is music muscle mania, my verses on steroids,
Private planes I'm on the jet son like Elroy,
Flying through the sky at amazing speed,
We on that superman kush or that amazing weed,
The new Bentley came out my team said LUDA GET IT,
Twenty thou says that I'm the only nigga WIT IT,
New Era on ya brain like a A-Town Fitted,
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so sick wit it,

What the fuck was you thinking?

Stinkin' like a dead body up in the woods,
So I stashed it like a weave coming up in the hood,
And if you down for no bad then we up to no good,
And it's important that you make it understood I'm a lyricist to the death so I got what ya need, Ludacris,
The last of a dying breed, and we almost extinct so I'm saying it loud,

Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the fifty yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for tree
And if you like in the club we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P.
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots so they gotta wait 'til the show stop
Or how 'bout on the beach with black sand
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man ain't Ludacris (woo) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it lover lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast 'em and I past 'em get a tight grip and I grasp 'em
I flash 'em and out last 'em
And if ain't good then I trash 'em while you stash 'em

With the candles lit you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage of the Ludacris concert
'Cause you know I got sold out
Or red carpet dick could just roll out
Go 'head and scream you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train when it's hot or when cold out
How 'bout in the library on top of books
But you can't be too loud
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name
Sauna, Jacuzzi in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn (woo) rose pedals on the silk sheets uh
Eating fresh fruits sweep yo woman right off her feet I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes

Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna get you in the back seat windows up
That's the way you like to fuck, clogged up fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt, rough sex make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown that's the way I like it twerk
Legs jerk, overworked, underpaid but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade, tag team, off the ropes
On the ocean or in the boat, factories or on hundred spokes
What about up in the candy sto' that chocolate chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs, smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream help play my game, Dracula man I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reigns, school teacher let me get my brains I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta, know what-what's your fantasy I wanna, lick you from yo' head to yo' toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the down to the to the flo'
Then I wanna, you make it so good I don't wanna leave

Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes
And I was always reached for the sky, I don't know why
I'ma little bitty kid wit' a whole bunch of gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, I'ma be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
I'ma have it made in the shade, I'ma be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matter fact I'm schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good

Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I ain't the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, don't let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he don't let me borrow nothing, but ask me what I want
I'ma tell him I wanna I want to (Diamond in the back)

I want to (Diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean) Why can't I walk with a limp mama? won't be no drama
For goodness sakes, I'm just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
"I could of swore it was mine," what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', ain't nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why can't work feel like retirement? I want to (Diamond in the back)
I want to (Sunroof top)

Imagine all the possibilities and the freaky things that we could do.
Blind folded,
Handcuffed to the head board never let you go until you scream my name,
Maybe you think I'm playin' but this is really far from a mothafuckin' game.
Ain't a damn thang changed still nasty as I wanna be.
And I got just what you want baby girl you want it,
See it'll turn you on and it's gonna be on as soon as I take it off.
Just give me your body its guaranteed that I'ma

Tell, tell, tell me a secret baby Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa
Tell me a secret
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa Wake uuuuuuuup
I see the sun shine gazing threw window pain
Blazing like indo flame its time to wake up
Co0me to ur senses manye
Snow is all around you
But you dont play no winter games
Cartrage all around you
But you dont play netendo games
Load them up and fill them up to the top
Before you cocking them
Trying to get from the botton to the top
Like the stock exchange
See I was shitting shaving
Hit the coner for a block exchange
Amazing what my people would do
For some pocket change
But maybe this aint the life you choose
This is the life you stay strapped and pack a knife
Or end up with a bloody nose
Street survival or survival of the street
And only the strong survive
There's no survival for the weak
Catch a sneak eak at death if ur not on ur p's & q's
They carry banana clip and niggas will peel u for ur shoes
This is the blues but not all hill street
U can call it kill or be killed street
Lost a pint of blood let it spill street
Stop and wake uuuuuuuuuup
Wake uuuuuuuuuup They say my folkes would do any thing for the fortune and fame
And it will take a fortune to get rid of all the pain
But im saying use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
You say the only family u got is in the game
And the only way to make is by sell cocain
But im say use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya)
Use ur brain homie do the right thing (let me talk to ya) Hi, my name's Ludacris, and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so yo' parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids "Actin' a Fool" from the traps to the burbs My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
So I shot the tooth fairy and took my old teeth back
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
I go fishin' on my lake, with yo' bitch as the bait
Plus I eat many MC's, but I don't gain no weight The number one chief rocka, clean out yo' rap lockers
I'm as stiff as a board, y'all more shook than maracas
But my trick ain't for kids, if you dig 'em, you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya, I'll spring forward, you fall back Every album that I drop has got more than ten bangers
That's cause I'm a shot caller, y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with Rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
'Cause every single is a smash, I'm hot as a camel's ass
The competition never just want to admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in the wash From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit' you
One of Mini-Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
I'm in the strip club smokin', with President Clinton So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They may the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq So yippie-kay-yay, yippie-yie-yie-yo
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro
I've been lookin' for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons So wash all ya sins away and stop playin'
If God's line is busy you might have to two-way him
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
And when I'm drunk tell them kids, "Drugs are bad, mmm'kay?" Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Got seven cars, get all my rims at Chrome Depot
And people think I'm bad, they say "Oooh he's so evil!"
'Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people But my album's out the store, yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
'Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home All that shit that y'all talkin', y'all can pop it to them
'Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellent I'm the man, I got money far as the eyes can see
And I'm in a group, I split dough with me, me and me
So much money in my jewelry that I'm damn near sorry
So I'm a trade my earrings in, and get a Ferrari I buy cars with straight cash, have meetings with Donald Trump
y'all meet with Honda, no payments for 12 months
Take a look at yo' life and no wonder you so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool! So I'm just sitting in this rehab class
Trying to get myself unhooked on ass
So then my teacher asked me a question

Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seats while I open your mind
And take you back to when I dropped down from heaven
And I came out my moms and had a mic as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you'd see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first rhyme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pastimes
Every where that I went spitting and babbling
Showing my ass, growing up then started traveling
From one city to the next, Luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape, did shows and got exposure
And kept learning as my black ass got older
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but stayed sharper then a Ginsu blade It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age fourteen, my talent show a beast outta cage
I would of won but disqualified for jumping off stage
But I ain't care, cause this game has started to open it's arms
When I was at Banneker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me, make a name for my block
People told me "keep flowing," they ain't want me to stop
Was back when Big Nose John was my human beat box
We'd skip school, hit open campus and watch out for street cops
Now I'm known around the town as that nigga that raps
From the hills that made high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demo's, perfecting the craft
And some said I wouldn't make it, they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books by Donald Goins
Bout the business of this shit, how to flip a few coins
Before the age of eighteen, I was destined to make it
My bank account read Disturbing The Peace, incorporated It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Age eighteen, I'm strugglin', just to survive
But got a gig workin' for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio, increasing their numbers
Still Ludacris but alias was Cris Luva Luva
Late nights I'm in they studio and using they tools
Me and Puma smoking weed and breaking all of their rules
And I was krunk, all the big wigs was hearing my songs
But nobody did shit and they was taking too long
So three years went past, and I saved enough cash
To make my own record label and put myself on blast
The album was independent, it was just for the streets
I sold a one thousand copies in my first fuckin' week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies bite me, but I chose Def Jam
And the main reason that I made it and I love the A-town
Was 'cause the block had its eye brows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? It ain't clean in these streets, it's mean in these streets
Glocks up, hats down, fiends in these streets
So please pay attention when you're coming around
'Cause the block got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me? Yea-uh, here we go here we go here we go
Talk about that Word of Mouf baby
Yeuh, yeuh yeuh yeuh yeuh! Here we go, here we go
Ludacris, 4-Ize, D.E. what you want now now now now Check it
You see I live a life filled with chicken and malt liquor
And women that are real life scratch'n'sniff stickers
I shoot videos and get knobs slobbed in trailers
Then hit stage and break a leg like Lawrence Taylor
You pricks is all talk, and it's bad for your health
See I ain't gotta say shit, money speaks for itself
With all models I make I'm great like five lakes
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates
You rolling on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirty as home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shaking they thangs
Then I put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be going to Hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail
I got Junkyard Dogs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, 'cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
"Word of Mouf" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass These rap cats is soft like R&B; singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggas one by one
Or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworking
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurking
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rolls with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I Alter Beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash

How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like afro-sheen
But they don't never really wanna pop them things
Cane, cane sugar man Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pull off so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that dro

Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club in the back door, nigga what?
Act like I don't make cloud, how you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But, I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest, and a pump hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (they got that work)
Don't it smell so good, in Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good

How you gonna act like I don't push lacs?
Black Eldorado, fifth wheel on back!
Ichy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a glock I'ma make 'em say please
In the back, on the block so the cops they freeze
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed, you gotta nose bleed?
Don't it smell so sweet?

On my American bandstands
Summer-salts, cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out of control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it drop
Tuck and twist if you don't like it, you're fuckin' Cris
I'm rubbing clits so stay and catch don't try to duck and miss
Do your stretches don't pull no hamstrings
You got me moving, in fact you doing the damn thing
Stronger muscles exercise every part of your body hurts
Let's do this sweating, thank God your bath and body works
I like a woman that makes her own doe, don't need a lot of help
But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garder belt
Lip gloss traces, your pierced in 11 places
And your lips downtown just made some familiar faces like whoa! Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Add a chapter to this pussy popping legacy
Trying ta be that bitch, can't no bitch come fuck wit me
When I pop that Cris I'm only business and bubbly
When I'm in the 6 wit 20's spinning I'm luxury
'Cause I got that head game
Fuckin' up that bed frame
But don't get me wrong, shawty gon' let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get your man shawty
'Fore he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
The way I break it down for you bitches, it's so explicit
Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that
Show me where the money at
Boy come wit them hunnid stacks
Breakin' wit that pussy popping
That pussy dropping to the flo'
And got these niggas slobbin'
He wantin' mo', without that dope, papi can't nothin' happen
'Cause that's fo' sho, I'm from the GOAT, you gettin' that pussy poppin'

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Every time we hit the club
We at least 50 deep
Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked
In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh
That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was "Strawberry"
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
"Here, you deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole"
Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles
Now pop that coochie, you know the procedure
If you want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or please us
Find me spending cheese up
Maxing out my visa
Tricking on strip teasers Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand [Chorus: x3]
Go to sleep, hoe to sleep, go to sleep, hoe to sleep
If you're tired be quiet and go to sleep, hoe to sleep Man, I tell a hoe to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make 'em six feet deep
'cause we knock 'em unconscious with that non-sense
Read in between that fine print, think about lyrical con-tent
Then about where your time spent
Mess around get your guys hit, a ten hut!
I send three-six ol' shit, nigga what?
If ya tired ya tired, if ya snooze ya lose
But'chu you won't wrap up ya bandages, or hell you would Nigga I got shotty's and semi's, I love 'dro and henne' ?
All brown and skinny, but I've fucked up so many
I got qp's and halves, if we beefin' I blast
You sleepin' I laugh, ask 'cris, I'm off the rip
I had this hoe who talked too much, I had to off the bitch
2-0, Mr. Crayola, niggas know what I mean
'cause I slang brown, white, yellow, purple and green
And all you fagot-muthafuckas gotta know the routine [Chorus: x4] Bitch it's me again, kickin' in your fuckin' doors
I look for div-idends, I ain't lookin' for you hoes
You bitch can't com-prehend, let me put one in your boot
Let me put one in your boat, so you ? can go to sleep
So, lay down bitch, gimme all that you dreamed for
Gimme fancy cars, gimme bling-bling-bling, boi
It don't mean a thing, boi, for me that ain't gon' swing, boi
Them god damn toys, do you know what I mean, boi? Now if you warrin' and runnin' from them three-six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or bustin' massive 'round some s.k.
My last trip to a-t-l I fucked yo' cascade
I'm strippin' bitches and I'm a ball fucker with a limp
They call me infer-stripper, sexy, red hoe's pimp
And quick to sink her on the nigga 'cause this what it's 'bout
We rob that trick and stick his dick off in his fuckin' mouth
We memphis niggas [Chorus: x4] North, north, south, south, westwood, orange mouth
Nigga we be smokin' life, never shut ya charlie brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch, pockets full, ya know we bail
Hooked up with my nigga 'cris, then we head to a-t-l
Playas wild, throwin' bows, tellin' chickens, "fuck you hoe!"
Nigga rollin' up the moe, as long that white shit up they nose
Mayn this town is like my town, so we stayed and hung around
Juicy j be high as fuck, catch me in the lost and found Better use common sense checkin' me out for bitch I can stand for
And up, get yaself in this clique
Without my tongue licks, behind me gettin' handcuffed by a slut
Look, I'm from gittero what?
Southside niggas throw it up when it's time to get buck
Niggas in the back of the club postin' up
Waitin' for a nigga that's new to make it up
Ass in, ain't no askin', it's no tolerance as long bitch check in
She wit' me, comments will only get'chu basically eternally resting
So abide by the call of the streets
If ya got a bitch better keep her on a leash
? gonna creep in ya home while you gone
Have you comin' back findin' nutt on yo' sheets [Chorus: x4] I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me
Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so mean in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my "Eye Candy"
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!"
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)

Yea the door kinda fucked up so you're gonna have to, uh
Climb through the window, is that cool?

I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together
I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together
So come on now and get up to it y'all The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cause the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independent women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dogs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, mid west, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B;, Pop-tart, what you want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal Cause they can't get what I got's
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon) Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these streets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these streets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is? I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Oh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way want to baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they don't want to listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they don't want to glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cause rules were made to be broken, but you can't make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', 'cause through this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, 'cause I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
C'mon Yeah, folk
The King of the kings has spoken

Eight figures in the bank and I pull yo rank

These snitches is after my riches and yes I smell bloody murder When I cock back with a drop dat can't block dat lock dat fools betta stop dat
Otherwise you can pop back

Pull out the roach, roll up the dough, money I'ma throw again holla at my folk
All I need is a bitch right now, to blow me away then take me down
I need another fuckin Conjure round, hot wing, Gucci, out to the lounge
You might just see me but I can't dig deep nigga with gold teeth
Nigga then O-D on VSOP, and if not now slowly but surely
Shake 'em like LeBron, shoot 'em like Kobe, if they say chill I just pay the police
In the club chillin with G-S-U-P, but after go down it's in D.T.P.
That's a rock, got you pissy and you dizzy, wanna hit me
But not really, please don't mix me, I'm a boss, my dogs bite quickly
If nobody's out here with me I'ma do this shit myself
Smoke and drink off for my health like I don't need nobody else
Scrap's so true to smokin crucial, swishin on swishas with Luda
I'm, in the Playas Circle, this G shit you hoes ain't used ta
I got my own kush pack and got my own liquor
"Ay what you call that?" I call it Cleveland
Now nigga! [Chorus:Repeat x7] I know everybody remember their first time
No matter how old you are
You gotta remember that very first time you did something man Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories (I remember, I remember)
Ain't nothing like the first time (ok)
or how things used to be (how they used to be girl)
Ain't nothing like the first time (hey mom I'm coming in I won't be too late)
remembering the memories(the green lights come on)
Ain't nothing like the first time (I gotta have your ass home)
or how things used to be Ok, come travel with me down memory lane
Back in my wonder years when nobody considered me sane
First time I got a whooping 'sRight where I begin
Cuz what I did I told my mom I'd never do it again
Round four years old and young Luda's a menace (yep)
But I cried the first time I had to go to the dentist
Cuz I was scared then a mug, I couldn't stand no doctors
But I loved getting drunk my first time off vodka (oh yeah)
'Til the very next morning I was hung on over (uh huh)
Proceeded to throw upon my grandma's sofa
It was nasty, I swore I wouldn't take another sip
The first time getting high I had to take another hit
It wasn't working at first then I started tweaking
Back seat of my boy's ride just laughing for no reason
Been rappin' since I was seve, I remember the time
Plus I wrote my first son when I was nine
And ain't nothing like the first time Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be Oh, you gotta go, you gotta get your ass out
Cuz im my momma come home, well she's likely to pass out man
That's what I said about my bust my first nuts
Cuz all through grade school we tried to bust the first slut
That we could geto our hands on, sex never last long
After sixty seconds tell that trick to put her pants on
It smell like badussy, and I don't like that
I'm about to call her four eyes and I'll be right back Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be I got memories in the corner of my mind
Misty watered colored memories, thinking bout the first time
That I learned how to ride my bike
And the first time I got into a fight
Or it could have been the first time
I got my heart broke by this girl I like
My first time to Atlanta was my first time on a plane
My first time on ecstacy I stood out in the rain
My first time getting grain I was in the backseat of Rudy car
The first time I stole was a sky box, basketball cards, and a candy bar
The first time I heard the legend, we robbed the dope boy
We got about thirty grand out
I was fifteen years old and in high school
And I had to tall Willy every look stand out
First everything, home brewing, bitch swing
Like Micheal when he won his first championship ring
And he cried with the trophy, that's like my first rhyme
First check for rapping on back for the first time
First met Quincy Jones, he said I looked like Snoop
I remember when me and Chris were in a group Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be
Ain't nothing like the first time
remembering the memories
Ain't nothing like the first time
or how things used to be And I had to tell Willy every look stand out
