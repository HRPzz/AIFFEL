In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time

(Something), something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Something), something, something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about baby you and I It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or Rock and Roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leaving without you Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's (Something), something, something about this place

There's only three men that I am a certain my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ (Something), something, something about the chase (six whole years)
I am a New York woman born to rock you down
So want my lipstick all over your face

Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up, you gave up I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke? I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless I'll never love again
Oh friend you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow
Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you? And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up? If I promised boy to you
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again How, how, how so speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless baby Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless? Oh oh oh I'll undress you, 'cause you're tired
Cover you as you desire
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms So baby tell me yes
And I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes
And I will be all yours tonight

(Last night) Our lovers quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)
Making love in my sex dreams (4x) [Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads! [Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you [Chorus 2]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my Sexxx dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you [Bridge]
You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him [Speaking]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks
And oh my god
(*vomits and giggles*) [Chorus 3]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my Sexxx dreams) [iTunes Festival Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool. I was naked, so were you, and I wrote this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [laughs]) Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick I wanna kiss you
But if I do then I might miss you, babe

Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me And what about our future plans?
Does it seem we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me So I said, "I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight" So I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took the road to nowhere on my own Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home And I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see world together
I don't wanna be alone forever
But I can be tonight, tonight 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy, I'm And then he asked me,
Said, "Baby, why do we love each other?"
I said, "Honey, it's simple.
It's the way that you love and treat your mother" Thought that I would be alone forever
But I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home
But I think with you I can spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life Would you go with me?
(For life)
See the world with me 'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
A gypsy, a gypsy, a gypsy

Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
You were a perfect illusion I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touchin' me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm wakin' up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion) (Where are you, 'cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (but I feel you watchin' me
Dilated, falling free
In a modern ecstasy)
(Where are you, 'cause I can't see you
It was a perfect illusion
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Illusion (but I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (where are you 'cause I can't see)
(But I feel you watchin' me)
Mistaken for love (dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)
Mistaken for love
In a modern ecstasy
In a modern ecstasy I'm over the show
Yeah at least now I know It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
(Aah) you were a perfect illusion

Somewhere in all the confusion

Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion It's like, I just love a cowboy you know
I'm just like, I just, I know, it's bad
But I'm just like
Can I just like, hang off the back of your horse
And can you go a little faster?! Three am, Mustang speedin'
Two lovers, headed for a dead end
Too fast, hold tight, he laughs
Runnin' through the red lights
Hollerin' over, rubber spinnin'
Big swig, toss another beer can
Too lit, tonight, prayin'
On the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Blue collar and a red-state treasure
Love junkie on a three-day bender
His grip, so hard, eyes glare
Trouble like a mug shot
Charged up, 'cause the man's on a mission
One, two ya, the gears are shiftin'
He called, I cried, we broke
Racin' through the moonlight Every john is just the same
I'm sick of their city games
I crave a real wild man
I'm strung out on John Wayne Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne So I go to the eye
Of the storm
Just to feel your love
Knock me over
Here I go
Into our love storm Baby let's get high, John Wayne
Baby let's get high, John Wayne Last night
(Our lovers quarrel)
I was thinking about you
(More than I can say)
And it was kind of dirty
(All night)
And the way that you looked at me
(Help me here)
It was kind of nasty
(Help me here)
It was kind of trashy
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought ('cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty) Help me here
'Cause I feel so trashy
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our head Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
And I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him I can't believe I'm telling you this but
I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)

Hey yo You're giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay Young, wild, American

And in the silence of the night
Through all the tears and all the lies
I touch myself and it's alright Just give in don't give up baby
Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty
That the world is gonna bend Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine
Stars in our eyes 'cause we're having a good time eh-eh eh-eh So happy I could die be your best friend

Open up your heart and your mind to me Just know when that glass is empty

Draggin' our love affair
Put on a pretty little number
I'm wearing you still
It was a hell of a scene at daddy's feast
Nobody saw it coming, but the little red devil in me
He has a funny way saying forever too fast
Don't get mad, can't blame a tramp
For something he don't have
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold Got a baby sister who looks just like me
She wants nothing more than a man to please
Maybe she's in too deep
Her love for him ain't cheap
But it breaks just like a knockoff piece from Fulton Street
The man's got a gift for getting what he wants
He's thirsty when he drinks
Gets on the brink, and throws her off
I get on my knees and beg you Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold I can carry you, but not your ghosts
Wish I had the faith, but I don't know, oh Hear my sinner's prayer
I am what I am
And I don't wanna break the heart of any other man
But you, but you
Hear my sinner's prayer
It's the only one I know
It sure as hell don't rhyme
But it's as good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold
Good as, good as, good as, good as gold (Verse 1:)
Hey babe,

You see I

I'm looking for someone that can handle me.
Need a fire so hot that it burns me so.

You and me were kind of in complete.
Need someone to say me he loveth me. Give it up

Leave the coffin open when I go
Leave my pearls and lipstick on so everybody knows
Pretty will be the photograph I leave
I'm laying down on famous knives so everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Someone I know could love and save me from myself
But maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you VERSE:
I'm hungry from an anorexic heart
I've been trying to tell you how I feel
But was never very smart
I'm wrapped in silks made for Egyptian queens
I'll do it in the swimming pool
So everybody sees Bleach out all the dark
I'll swallow each peroxide shot
Maybe someone I love could save me from myself
Or maybe I'll just clean the shit off these fancy shoes
I'll be a Princess Die and die with you CHORUS:
I wish that I was strong
I wish that I was wrong
I wish that I could cope
But I took pills and left a note POST-CHORUS:
Princess die
I want to see her cry
Princess die
Princess die
We want to watch her cry
Princess die REPEAT CHORUS BRIDGE:
I wish that I could go in my rich boyfriends limo
Right after he proposed with a 16-carat stone wrapped in rose gold OUTRO:
The final act of life will be my own hands to do,
Ill be a Princess and die with you

This drink is my last one
I know I fucked up again
Because I lost my only friend
God forgive my sins
Don't leave me, I
Oh I will hate myself until I die My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low, from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep on searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
Need you more than dope
I need you more than dope Toast one last puff
And two last regrets
Three spirits and
Twelve lonely steps
Up heaven's stairway to gold
Mine myself like coal
A mountain of a soul
Each day, I cry
Oh, I feel so low from living high My heart would break without you
Might not awake without you
Been hurting low, from living high for so long
I'm sorry, and I love you
Sing with me, "Bell Bottom Blue"
I'll keep searching for an answer cause I need you more than dope I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope
I need you more than dope I need you more
Need you more
I need you more than dope [Verse 1]
I always thought it was you,
You always thought it was me.
We always thought we were it,
Seemed like a real perfect fit,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. I always thought even though,
We were so young we could grow.
Up in the end it'd be us,
We'd take the F or the bus,
Where Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Verse 2]
I miss our cheap chandelier
'Member when dad hung it there?
And we would watch Rocky IV,
The one where the Russian scored,
I loved Brigitte Nielsen's hair. I'd call you my champion
Thought we had already won
And cracked open our last beer,
Falling asleep in our tears,
Those Brooklyn Nights set us free. [Chorus]
It's not that I don't wanna love you
I'ts not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
It's just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Bridge]
I found an old pair of
Keys in my purse that opened
The lockup we shared
How did they get there, jerk?
I wanna see you there
I wanna make it work. I didn't brush my hair
And my lashes are falling
Off of seven years
Of our bad luck dating.
I want one last night there,
A Brooklyn Night affair. [Chorus]
Its not that I don't wanna love you
Its not that I'm really over it, you know (you know)
Its just that I can't watch us bleed to death
When we used to be
Brooklyn Nights happy. [Outro]
Its not that I don't want to love you
Cause I really tried, and I
Just wanna hang with the old you
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Have a drink with your former self
We both won't act like someone else
Maybe then we'd both tell the truth
For just one Brooklyn Night adieu Huh oh
Yeah yeah
Huh oh
Whoa woa
Oh I
I feel good
I walk alone
But then I trip over myself and I fall, I
I stand up
And then I'm OK
But then you print some shit that makes me want to scream So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me
If you're wondering, know that I'm not sorry
Do what you want, what you want with my body
What you want with my body! You can't have my heart and you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body My bones hurt from all the show hmm
But I don't feel the pain 'cause I'm a pro I
I sink in and then I'm okay eh,
'Cause my body belongs to you when I'm on stage eh So do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, don't stop, let's party
Do what you want, what you want with my body
Do what you want, what you want with my body Write what you want, say what you want 'bout me

You can't stop my voice 'cause
You don't own my life but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart (apart)
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party (ey!) You can't have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want with my body
Do what you want with my body
You can't stop my voice 'cause

What you want with my body (world)(what you want with my body)
Do what you want with my body Come to me, in all your glamour, and cruelty
Just do the thing that you do
And I'll undress you Give it tight, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you? A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Come to me, without your sub-techs and fantasy
Just do the thing that you do
For my love is you Love is fly, I've flown my beaches with lover's side
The color's palette you choose
Can profit you A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
my artpop could mean anything [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Brushes with darkness wont help you create
your destiny of self but Artpop could mean anything
Anything
I tried to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music not the bling
Music not the bling [Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP Free my mind, ARTPOP

Downtown Just another way to prove I love you and it's hard today
I'll lay back in my chair and find a way
And when you say that thing that you say that makes me mad
I'll turn away, I'll turn away, I'll turn away And think of different ways to keep my spirits up
And choreograph hours with playful, joyous thoughts We both know I could learn a thing or two
About relaxing, hey, I love you
And after all, it's just another day Oh, I could use some two or three
Or other kind of ways to be
But today I won't be so hard on me
I'll walk alone down a different street
And smile at all the new strange I meet And pick up unique style, I'll kick around today
And create simple thoughts, I'll laugh in humble ways We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day Come on, Mark Ladies and gentlemen, Brian Newman We both know I could learn a thing or two
About behaving, but I love you
And after all, it's just another day And after all it's just another day Midnight rush, with a pen in my hand
Dink in link in, sand-script with a fan
Remembering me, before it began
Sometimes I felt so def in a jam
But the ones who loved me, told me to stop
Like home girl can't catch shit if it drops
A superwoman chick, you know that I am
Some shit don't fly by me in a man 'Cause I do not accept any less
Than someone just as real, as fabulous Don't want no paper gangsta
Won't sign away my life to
Someone whose got the flavor

Babe Last time I thought we had this talk
Boy you were getting ready to leave
I thought that baby you were done
Cause for a while you could barely look at me This time I thought that we`d be fine
That I`d forget the things that you said
I tried crossing out your words But baby you can not forget the past
Oh oh oh oh babe
Can not forget the past
Oh oh oh oh, Still baby (Babe) I'm so unpredictable
you don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around the second time around We tried going back to Joe's
That always was our favorite place
Long rides baby by the coast
Do you remember where we stayed Last time we where hanging out
You were acting kind of strange
Now it's the second time around
I'm sorry now it's me that feels this way
Oh oh oh oh babe
(My heart just speaks to me)
Its me that feels this way
Oh oh oh babe I now you are the one that is hurting I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder the second time around I'm so unpredictable
Just like you used to be
So unemotional
Boy I can't forget the way you were with me
I don't know what to tell you now
It's always harder
the second time around I`m not sure the best of way to say this
But I can't pretend to love you no more babe
This ferris wheel`s got me crazy
Maybe the second time around is not meant for us babe
Not meant for us babe hey-yeah! I'm so unpredictable
You don't know what to think
So unemotional
Wonder if I'm even still in love
You see

There's a change I'm here to see
I walk alone on a lonely road
I've many wonders to believe You can try to hear the talk
Or selling out a masterpiece
You've got a trunk full of gold
I've got someone to believe This ain't about Kings or Queens
Ain't about You and Me.
Do you need a dose of truth?
What am I supposed to do? How can you deal with it (With it)
Do you just avoid the guilt
Something you gotta I know,
If you can deal with me,
Shut your mouth, sip on that TEA! It's been so long
Since I've had a sip and I get this feeling
I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight Red one lady gaga haha baby baby baby baby i anit gonna runaway runaway run run run run away
Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need. Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care I just wanna dance
I don't really care... care... care (feel it in the air... yeah) [Chorus]
She's being a crazy dita disco diva... and you wonder:
"Who's that chick? who's that chick?"
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
Who's that chick? who's that chick?
Who's that chick? who's that chick? Back on the dancefloor better not to take me home

She's a mean and crazy dita disco diva... and you wonder:

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more. -chorus-
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Stickss and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me.

Who's that chick? who's that chick? The hills are alive,
With the sound of music
With songs they have sung
For a thousand years The hills fill my heart,
With the sound of music
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears My heart wants to beat
Like the wings of the birds
That rise from the lake to the trees My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies
From a church on a breeze To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls
Over stones on its way
To sing through the night
Like a lark
Who is learning to pray I go to the hills
When my heart is lonely
I know I will hear
What I've heard before
My heart will be blessed,
With the sound of music
And I'll sing once more Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad Edelweiss,Edelweiss
Bless my homeland forever. Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream A dream that will need
All the love you can give
Everyday of your life
For as long as you live Climb ev'ry mountain
Ford ev'ry stream
Follow ev'ry rainbow
Till you find your dream I am so fab

You're giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're givin' me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
If you could find a dry way, I'd forever be still
But you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons And if you say something that you might even mean
It's hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're giving me a million reasons
Give me a million reasons
Givin' me a million reasons
About a million reasons I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one to stay Baby I'm bleedin', bleedin'
Stay
Can't you give me what I'm needin', needin'
Every heartbreak makes it hard to keep the faith
But baby, I just need one good one
Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one When I bow down to pray
I try to make the worst seem better
Lord, show me the way
To cut through all his worn out leather
I've got a hundred million reasons to walk away
But baby, I just need one good one, good one
Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
Baby, I just need one good one to stay I was five and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
Remember when we used to play Bang bang, I shot you down
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang Now he's gone I don't know why
Until this day, sometimes I cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie Bang bang, he shot me down
Bang bang, I hit the ground
Bang bang, that awful sound
Bang bang, my baby shot me down Put some lipstick on
