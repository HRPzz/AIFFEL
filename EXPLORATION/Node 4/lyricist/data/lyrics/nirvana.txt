Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I gazed a gazley stare at all the millions here
We must have died along, a long long time ago
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control

They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see 'em again till the fourth of July Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils
Fight to claim them for their own Wouldn't you believe it

So what should I do? The finest day
That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say? It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on aplain
I can't complain This is out of our reach

I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To make you a deal
We've make a pact
To learn from who
Ever we want
Without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still, smell her on you
Smell her on you It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear you're asking wherever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same
I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false withness, we hope you're still with us,
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient,
A display of patience, disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars,
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground
I miss the comfort in being sad And if you save yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
And you'll think you're happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
And you'll think you're happy...
He'll cover you with grass,
And you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. And if you cut yourself,
You will think you're happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll make him happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you'll think you're happy...
He'll cover you with grass,
Then you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh. And if you fool yourself,
You will make him happy!
He'll keep you in a jar,
Then you'll think you're happy...
He'll give you breathing holes,
Then you will seem happy...
You'll wallow in the shit,
Then you'll think you're happy... now! You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
You're in a laundry room,
Conclusion came to you, ohhh... If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth? I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth? I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me I'm goin' to Hollywood, they'll see that I'm so good
I won't care how I feel, and I'll get to fuck Brooke Shields
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in I want to be a star, I'm going to have a car
And you'll have to admit, I'll be rich as shit
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in I would give you some, if you only would have treated me nice
You'll wish that you did, you'll feel pretty stupid
I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in It's fun to be a star, it's nice to have a car
Yeah, you'll have to admit, that I'll be rich as shit
And I'll just sit and grin, the money will roll right in Teenage angst has paid off well
Now I'm bored and old
Self-appointed judges judge
More than they have sold If she floats than she is not
A witch like we had thought
A down payment on another
One at Salem's lot Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore As my bones grew they did hurt
They hurt really bad
I tried hard to have a father
But instead I had a dad I just want you to know that I
Don't hate you anymore
There is nothing I could say
That I haven't thought before Serve the servants - oh no
That legendary divorce is such a bore Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at Grandpa Joe's
I kicked and screamed, said please don't go Grandma take me home Had to eat my dinner there
Mashed potatos and stuff like that
I couldn't chew my meat too good She said, well, don't you start your crying
Go outside and ride your bike
That's what I did, I killed my toe After dinner, I had ice cream
I fell asleep and watched TV
I woke up in my mother's arms Grandma take me home
I wanna be alone Come on over
Do the twist (aha)
Overdo it
Have a fit (aha)
Come on over
Shoot the shit (aha)
Love you so much
Makes me sick (aha)
Beat me out of me (beat it, beat it)
She keeps it pumpin' strait in my heart. If you wouldn't mind, I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to lose
If you wouldn't care, I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind, I would like to breath Is there another reason for your stain
Could you believe who we knew stress or strain
Here is another word that rhymes with shame You could do anything Your life is shit
Shit
Your life is over
Bull
Your life is mine
Cry
Your life is hell
Hell
I'm gonna die
Dying with you just
I'm going to die
To wear my libido

"I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
I'm gonna open myself up a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off
I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf with my 800 dollar a month tax free Century 21
Shop And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups I've accumulated
Over the past 62 years Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood and cut them up into two by two piece squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap and I'm going to cut them into two by two
Piece squares and then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach and I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood and glue them onto the
Plywood and burlap Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words When you're finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work it took was fun Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some said it was in Greenland and some in Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions Gotta find a way

If I may what is right,
Summon time too see me,
He lives in his bonnet,
A face from his pocket,
Chains mowing life from trees. Do Re Mi.
If I may,
If I might,
Wake me up, see me,
If I do and if I lie,
Find me out see me,
If I may cold as ice,
I may have too see me,
The ways in his socket,
The face from his moment,
The chains from his socket, Do Re Mi.
Wish me good,
Wish me light,
Find me out, see me,
If I may just be quiet,
Follow hate and be me,
Hello and if I sigh,
Shake me out; TV,
If I may and if I might,
Gotta gun to bleed,
Rays in his pocket,
Rays from his wallet,
Chains from his armor,
Am I deep? Do Re Mi. I really love you baby

Get hot

Cold heart
Cold heart

Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart
Cold heart Yeah She should have stayed away from friends
She should have had more time to spend
She should have died when she was born
She should have worn the crown of thorns She should have been a son She should have stood out in the crowd
She should have made her mother proud
She should have fallen on her stance
She should have had another chance Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my fulfill In the someday what's that sound? Broken heart and broken bones
Think of how a castrated horse feels
(Alt: Think about some capsules of horse pills)
One more quirky cliche'd phrase
You're the one I wanna refill In the someday what's that sound? This song is for lovers out there
And the little light in the trees
And all the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily
We're together once again my love
I need you back oh baby baby
I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl you'll only break my heart...
I can feel it I can hold it I can rub it I can shape it
I can mold it I can cut it I can taste it I can spank it
Beat it
Masturbate it
I been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol' city boy
Won't you spank through?
I can make you do things you won't think you ever could Hey, I just wanted to know.
Do you like me?
Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starved without your skeleton key I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think? I think Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke I love you for what I am not
I did not want what I have got
Blanket acne'd with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns What is wrong with me?
What is what I need
What do I think? I think Hate, hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth What is wrong with me?
What is wrong with me?

Lay down easy, lay it down seamy, sad man You don't want to hear this
Nothin' but a whore
I will play the leader
With pain
Now you know I'm needy
Lay them down easy
Lay them down easy Talk to me
In your own language please I am my own parasite
I don't need a host to live
We feed off of each other
We can share our endorphns
Doll steak, test meat I won my own pet virus
I get to pet and name her
Her milk is my shit
My shit is her milk Doll steak, test meat
Look on the bright side is suicide
Lost eyesight I'm on your side
Angel left wing, right wing, broken wing
Lack of iron and/or sleeping
Protector of the kennel

Obituary birthday
Your scent is still here in my place of recovery It's an odd alliance
It's another light I say What alone tonight
Even if my eyes
Even have some time
Bet it all tonight Listen I have been banging away
Even if you had a sight
My It's mad enough tonight
And forests have never grown
It's another light
And I can never have mine It's not mine
It's not mine
Instead I hide I've been here for my friends
I never know if I said
Watching out for me
When I can love you
Have your way And she might as well know I
Seem more high
High
Than
I said minerals will make the world
If we did not have chemicals
You would not be writing my death certificate Biting is my friend
My dog left me a sand send
One more day than I can plan
Ends safe from you
Biting ass a lie friend
When I will never have a friend
Biting silent as a man
His silence setting up around And she improvised
And she was supervised
I was a rised
Or arosed
Or a rose
Or a rose
Or aroused
And fine
Fine line
When I
Said night time
When I
Could never kind
And I My milk is your shit
My milk is your shit
It's hard and boiled
And sour all again
My milk is your shit It revolves
It evolves
Cause it's biting out what would My milk is your shit
My milk is piss
Don't you love that I can bite  Straight as an arrow

Baby, suddenly find her
Daddy, exploring only Like the fucking resume

If she ever comes down now
Nah
If she comes down now Oh
She looks so good
Oh
She's made out of wood
She says oh Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice Go away - get away, get away, get a-way
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume To hope is admittance
Feed before beginning
Double-sided cynics
Reflected image
Don't be so selfish
Leave in me this
Follow it far
To find where you are
You haven't grown
Go on alone
Never finished his sentence
Remained in seclusion
For the next few days
The family circle noose
He had removed us
All the styles of heresy
Finally he appeared unexpectedly
Looking for company I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put in to this
I always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail Pain
Pain
Pain You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let?s talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew to come like this Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail Pain
Pain
Pain You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right

It's a years subscription of bad puns.
And it makes your story our concern
And you set it up for returns My opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x4)

Your state of emotion seems to clear.
You rise and fall like wall street stock
And you had an affect on our happy talk. Our opinions. Mmm. Mmm. (x2)

It's a years subscription of bad puns.
And it makes your story our concern
And you set it up for returns They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
They kind with seashells driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he will ever know
He loves her more than he will ever show
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves him more than he would ever know
He loves her more than he would ever show Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
Keeps her photographs close to her heart
Keep the bitterness close to the heart They lead a lifetime that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make their living off of arts and crafts
The kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves her more than he would ever know
He loves her more than he would ever show I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary lies
I take pride as the kind of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice If you ever need anything please don't hesitate
to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naive.
I've seen it all I was here first Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me [Repeat x2]
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam
Sunbeams are never made like me
Don't expect me to cry,
For all the reasons you had to die
Don't ever ask your love of me Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die
Don't expect me to cry
Don't expect me to lie
Don't expect me to die for me When I'm feeling tired
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around
Soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again
A good hosing down The lady whom I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate I said so
I said so
I said so
Nirvana, nirvana, nirvana, nirvana Black windows of paint
I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones
They point in my way
They come with a flash of light
And take my family away
