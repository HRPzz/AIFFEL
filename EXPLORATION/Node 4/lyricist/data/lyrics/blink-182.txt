Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me Please tell me
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my cloths on
I came in throught the window... Last night
And your... Gone
Gone It's no suprise to me I am my own worst enemy
Cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
Still buring Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in throught the windo last night
And your gone
Gone Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my clothes on
I came inthrough the windo last night It's no suprise to me
I am my own worst enemy
Cuz every now and then I kick the livin' shit out of me Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean to call you that I, I can't get you more pregnant
but if you're worried,
all I can take care of myself,
I can take care of myself. Remember the days
We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home (find my way home) Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach (out of reach) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion) Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
Where are you and I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you)
(I miss you, miss you) (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends (I miss you I miss you)

The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
(I miss you miss you) I took her out, it was a Friday night
I wore cologne to get the feeling right
We started making out and she took off my pants
But then I turned on the TV And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by TV shows
What the hell is A.D.D.?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? Then later on, on the drive home
I called her mom from a pay phone
I said I was the cops
And your husband's in jail
The state looks down on sodomy And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls
What the hell is call ID?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? And that's about the time she walked away from me
Nobody likes you when you're twenty three
And you still act like you're in freshman year
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? That's about the time she broke up with me
No one should take themselves so seriously
With many years ahead to fall in line
Why would you wish that on me?
I never want to act my age
What's my age again, what's my age again? What's my age again? All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cock-sucker,
Mother-fucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat. I fucked your mom
I wunna suck my dad, and my mom too, oh is this thing on? (I miss you miss you) Hello there the angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends (I miss you I miss you)

The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)
(I miss you miss you) It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving, you must have your reasons
The season is calling, your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace, the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again
I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
Sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own, well I guess this is growing up
Well I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave, we'll pretend it's okay
The charade, it won't last, when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own, well I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone I never conquered, rarely came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault I never conquered, when you came
Sixteen just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait till I got home
To pass the time in my room alone I never conquered, when you came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I can still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait till I get home
To pass the time in my room alone In the car I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm just scared of what you think
You make me nervous so I really can't eat Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever Let's go
Don't wait
This night's almost over
Honest, let's make
This night last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever
Forever and ever
Let's make this last forever I've been here before a few times
And I'm quite aware we're dying
And your hands they shake with goodbyes
And I'll take you back if you'd have me
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always And I'll miss your laugh your smile
I'll admit I'm wrong if you'd tell me
I'm so sick of fights I hate them
Lets start this again for real So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready
So here I am I'm trying
So here I am are you ready Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night

And I'm quite aware we're dying Come on let me hold you touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always
Touch you feel you
Always
Kiss you taste you all night
Always (Get ready for action!)
I got to regret right now (I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and null (I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
Fuck it it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again
After you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone
On the street with a cigarette
On the first night we met Look to the past
And remember her smile
And maybe tonight
I can breathe for a while
I'm not in the seat
I think I'm fallin' asleep
But then all that it means is
I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna I said settle down, settle down everything is fine
Take your eyes off the floor
She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright
I lost my head on the door She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for She said I let her down, let her down I no longer dream
Of anything anymore
Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all you make me want to scream
And threw herself on the floor She's a-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a-antisocial
A-a-a
She's an angel yeah I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) She's not complicated
Can't be overstated at all
She's not complicated-ated-ated at all I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) (she's out of her mind)
She said babe I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight (wooo oh oh ohhh oh)
She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head
I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind (wooo oh oh ohhh oh) Oh yeah
We all need something to live for
Oh yeah
We all need something to live for It's hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
It's so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem could fix this home
I'd read it every day So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right Their anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather than fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along, so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And this is what she wants
Then why is there so much pain? So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time
You gave it all away
It was mine
So when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night
Twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
For real 'cause you were driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end is not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on I can't keep your voice out of my head
All I hear are the many echoes of
The darkest words you said
And it's driving me crazy I can't find the best in all of this
But I'm always looking out for you
'Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
Do you grin inside, you're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know, I'm here to stay We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell

I don't need anyone I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone There's an echo pulling out the meaning
Rescuing a nightmare from a dream
The voices in my head are always screaming
That none of this means anything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long There's a stranger staring at the ceiling
Rescuing a tiger from a tree
The pictures in her head are always dreaming
Each of them means everything to me And it's a long way back from seventeen
The whispers turn into a scream
And I'm, I'm not coming home Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh) I think I met her at the minute that the rhythm was set down
(Oh oh oh oh) I said I'm sorry I'm a little bit of a letdown
(Oh oh oh oh) but all my friends are daring me to come over
(Oh oh oh oh) so I come over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) so let me buy you a drink and we'll pretend that you think
(Oh oh oh oh) that I'm the man of your dreams come to life in a dive bar
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over
(Oh oh oh oh) and we'll go over and over and over Save your breath, I'm nearly
Bored to death and fading fast
Life is too short to last long
Back on earth, I'm broken
Lost and cold and fading fast
Life is too short to last long (Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh life is too short to last long)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) Yeah my girlfriend takes me home when I'm too drunk to drive
And she doesn't get all jealous when I hang out with the guys
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And my girlfriend likes ul and dhc
And she's so smart and independent
I dont think she needs me
Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Yeah my girlfriend takes collect calls from the road
And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm lacking in the bulge
She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does
She brings me mexican food from sombrero just because And when I feel like giving up like my world is falling down
I show up at three a.m. she's still up watching vacation
And I see her pretty face it takes me away to a better place And I know that everything's gonna be fine Hanging out behind the club on the weekend
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour
I remember it's the first time that I saw her there She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing
I'm kind of nervous cause I think all her friends hate me
She's the one, she'll always be there
She took my hand and that made it I swear Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show When we said we were gonna move to Vegas
I remember the look her mother gave us
Seventeen without a purpose or direction
We don't owe anyone a fucking explanation I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show Black and white picture of her on my wall
I waited for her call
She always kept me waiting
And if I ever got another chance
I'd still ask her to dance
Because she kept me waiting I fell in love with the girl at the rock show
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know
She's so cool, I'm gonna sneak in through her window
Everything's better when she's around
I can't wait till her parents go out of town
I fell in love with the girl at the rock show With the girl at the rock show
With the girl at the rock show (I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show
(I'll never forget tonight) with the girl at the rock show The drops of rain they fall all over
This awkward silence makes me crazy
The glow inside burns light upon her
I'll try to kiss you if you let me
(this can't be the end)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Your vows of silence fall all over
The look in your eyes makes me crazy
I feel the darkness break upon her
I'll take you over if you let me
(You did this)
Tidal waves they rip right through me
Tears from eyes worn cold and sad
Pick me up now, I need you so bad.
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
Down down down down
It gets me so It's understood, I said it many ways
Too scared to run, I'm too scared stay
I said I'd leave, but I could never leave her
And if I did, you know I'd never cheat her But this I ask, it's what I want to know
How would you feel, if I should choose to go
Another guy, you think he'd be unlike me
Another guy, you think he'd want to fight me She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train I heard it once, I'm sure I heard it twice
My dad used to give me all of his advice
He would say you got to turn your back and run now
Come on son, you haven't got a chance now She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train She's a dove, she's a fucking nightmare
Unpredictable, it was my mistake to stay here
On the go and it's way too late to play
I need a girl that I can train Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now Need a girl that I can train
Need a girl that I can train
Turn your back and run now
You haven't got a chance now Nineteen, your eyes are glowing to my beating heart
Oh, it seems like it is fine as my hand is moving up your arm
And you never really know where it goes up until it starts
I got my eye on you
Whatcha gonna do Day dream near a stream with the linear bites
Oh, I listen to the song on repeat from the other night
And I can't picture you but I sure got the feeling right
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl And we wake from the night in a bed with a bruise
And we're laughing out loud over the craziest news
And you reached for my hand I was scared in your room
We fell on the floor and we started to move
And your hands were like birds as they flew from the coop
Up my back they would climb just as I came unglued She said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be there to try it again Nineteen as we roll across the bedroom floor
Your eyes they cannot lie as you're dreaming of our future home
And the kids are growing up as you and I we are growing old
What a crazy world
Pretty little girl In the rain with the drink from the back of the bar
I would raise up my voice, you would raise it up more
We'd forget that our lives being apart it is hard
We'd thought we were close but it still feels far
Can we learn to get by if we learn to have scars
If we learn to forgive and accept who we are You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to do it again Wait a minute hold up a second
Don't leave me here with this feeling
Like I'm the one full of regret
Like I never did good for us both
Like you never did pull out that weapon
And stick that knife in my back
Was I supposed to accept it
When your words are like
More than just sticks and stones
Kinda like a bullet
A hollow tip that lodged in my bones
And I can't just swallow it
My pride is more than all that I own
So I gotta give it away
And some of the times I'm all the way wrong
But can't you see past me and see my fucked up home
That made me the meanest, the devil is just singing along
To the song I write til I'm alone at night
And I hang up the phone and bite my tongue
'Cause I know that me and you is just only right but one It's a cry from the past we have been through a lot
Every year has been great and a few have been tough
And your kids they will reach for the stars up above
We'll sit and relax as we cheer in the morrow
The ropes to the light from the crypt to the grave
We started alone in the end we're okay You said
If you break my heart then I'll change your mind
And I'll do it again
If you play the part then I will play mine
And I'll do it again
If we miss the mark if we hold on tight
We'll be here to try it again Im sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind
An oversensitive guy
That hes lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant
Our favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone I cant forgive
Cant forget, cant give in
What went wrong?
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life Im sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place, its fucking cursed
In its plague and I can never escape
When my heart, it explodes I cant forgive
Cant forget, cant give in
What went wrong?
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong?
Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong? Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong?
Im kicking out fiercely
At the world around me
What went wrong? Im kicking Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
Shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tit fart turd and twat
I fucked your mom
And I want to suck my dad
And my mama too
Oh, is this thing on? I swear that I can go on forever again
Please let me know that my one bad day will end
I will go down as your lover, your friend
Give me your lips and with one kiss we begin
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'll leave my room open till sunrise for you
I'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you
Where are you now I can hear footsteps I'm dreaming
And if you will, keep me from waking to believe this Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of being alone
Cause I am, I'm lost without you
Are you afraid of leaving tonight
Cause I am, I'm lost without you I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
I'll be fine, it's not the first
Just like last time, but a little worse, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." One more chance, I'll try this time
I'll give you yours, I won't take mine
I'll listen up, pretend to care
Go on ahead, I'll meet you there, and She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, "don't let your future be destroyed by my past."
She said, "don't let my door hit your ass." Let's try this one more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling
One more time with feeling She said that I'm not the one that she thinks about and
She said it stopped being fun, I just bring her down
I said, don't let your future be destroyed by my past.
She said, don't let my door hit your ass Don't leave me all alone
Just drop me off at home
And I'll be fine Remember the days
We would drink on the train
On our way to the show, Chicago
Naked Raygun live at the Cabaret Metro
Ten bucks to get into a fight you can't win
Boots and braces, yellow laces
Oxblood traces of the night before We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
(Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na)
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot I can't wait 'til I'm off of work
I'll meet my friends at the Target curb
I rolled my ankle, Matt just broke his wrist
I climbed through your window at 3am
We listened to The Smiths and The Violent Femmes
Yeah, we both sang, "Why can't I get one kiss?" We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot We are the broken
No end in sight
We're the forgotten soldiers you left behind
There's no use trying
We lost the war
Now the dead and dying
Are back to even the score We are forgotten young suburbia
Loose on the streets of California
Underneath fluorescent lights
We'll waste the best nights of our life
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot
Na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, na na
Fuck this place, let's put up a parking lot It's alright to tell me what you think about me
I won't try to argue or hold it against you
I know that you're leaving you must have your reasons
The season is calling and your pictures are falling down The steps that I retrace the sad look on your face
The timing and structure did you hear he fucked her?
A day late a buck short I'm writing the report
On losing and failing when I move I'm flailing now And it's happened once again I'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands and sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And I've been here for too long
To face this on my own
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up And maybe I'll see you at a movie sneak preview
You'll show up and walk by on the arm of that guy
And I'll smile and you'll wave we'll pretend it's okay
The charade it won't last when he's gone I won't come back And it'll happen once again
You'll turn to a friend
Someone that understands
And sees through the master plan But everybody's gone
And you've been there for too long
To face this on your own
Well, I guess this is growing up Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up
Well, I guess this is growing up Everything has fallen to pieces
Earth is dying help me Jesus
We need guidance
We've been misled
Young and hostile
But not stupid
Corporate leaders, politicians
Kids can't vote, adults elect them
Mobs that rule the school and workplace
Signs that caution, sixteen's unsafe We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame Let this train wreck burn more slowly
Kids are victims in this story
Drown our youth with useless warnings
Teenage rules they're f***ed and boring We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to pieces
Everything has fallen to We really need to see this through
We never wanted to be abused
We'll never give up, it's no use
If we're f***ed up
You're to blame He pauses shaving and he tells himself that he is the bomb
She has her curlers set, her credit cards are paying the funds
He's not that old, I've been told, a strong sexual goal
They go out everyday she goes every way, oh yeah
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She smokes a dozen and he doesn't seem to notice the smell
He took the seat off his own bike because the way that it felt
He wants to bone, this I know, she is ready to blow
They go out every night, his pants are super tight, oh yeah
They don't even care at all She's open waiting for more (she's open for more)
And I know he's only looking to score (he's only looking to score)
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before She's open waiting for more
And I know he's only looking to score
And it is way too unhealthy
Often they've typically been starved for attention before Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk...
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said
Or what you threw at me Please tell me
Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I am sleeping with my cloths on
I came in throught the window... Last night
And your... Gone

Cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going offf and there a cigarette
Still buring Please tell me why
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in throught the windo last night
And your gone
Gone Please tell me why

I didn't mean to call you that Come here, please hold my hand LORD now
Help me, I'm scared please show me how
To fight this, God has a master plan
And I guess, I am in his demand Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see, you when this is done
And now I, have come to realize
That you are, the one who's left behind Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting I see, the light it feels good
And I'll come, back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss Please stay, until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on, to me
I'm right here, waiting
And take, my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here, waiting [Repeat: x3] We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive
And I hold on tight
But not enough to hold you back It feels like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
This room is such a lonely place without you I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place I love the lightning but hate the rain
Tomorrow's frightening but not today
Wish I could slow down time
But not enough to slow you down I feel like the moon
Is spinning off into outer space without you
The universe an empty place without you I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place We're falling faster than we can fly
Forgotten seconds out on Sunset Drive I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me I wish that we could save today
But I know we can't stay the same
And I keep pushing you away
Don't wait for me
Don't wait for me Home is such a lonely place without you
Home is such a lonely place Home is such a lonely place I always flirt with death
I look ill but I don't care about it
I can face your threats and
Stand up straight and tall and shout about it I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win
But I won't need rehabilitating, oh no I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you
Another girl, another planet
Another girl, another planet Space travel's in my blood
There ain't nothing I can do about it
Long journeys wear me out but
I know, I can't live without it oh no I think I'm on another world with you
With you
I'm on another planet with you
With you Another girl, who's loving you now
Another planet, who's holding you down
Another planet Please, mom
You ground me all the time
I know that I was right
All along And I'm hoping
Remember I'm a kid
I know not what I did
Just having fun You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Shit, dad
Please don't kick my ass
I know I've seen you trashed
At least one time Can I blame it
On one of my dumb friends
It's been awhile
Since I have used that line You couldn't wait for something new
And yesterday I thought of you
It left me to think as if I couldn't walk away
It's too late, I fell through Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before (Alright) Nothing to lose
A boy who went out when he finished all his chores
Nothing to do
They can't trust me because I blew it once before Beige little boxes in a row
Neighbors and friends that you don't know
Here's a form, go wait in line
Can't you see I'm doing fine, it's what I've always wanted Two little kids out on the lawn
Once we had love, now it's gone
Good things haven't happened yet
I'm empty as a movie set, it's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Wearing all black out on the beach
Faces I've seen in magazines
Let's take a walk out on the pier
Watch the shoreline disappear, iIt's what I've always wanted Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh)
Na, na na, na na, na na, na na (woah-ohh) Hey, here's to you California
Beautiful haze of suburbia
Living in the perfect weather
Spending time inside together
Hey, here's to you California Cut the skin to the bone
Fall asleep all alone
Hear your voice in the dark
Lose myself in your eyes
Choke my voice Say goodnight
As the world falls apart
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this Here's a letter for you
But the words get confused
And the conversation dies
Apologize for the past
Talk some shit take it back
Are we cursed to this life Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this I'm talking to the ceiling
My life just lost all meaning
Do one thing for me tonight
I'm dying in this silence The last star left in heaven
Is falling down to earth and
Do you still feel the same way
Do you still feel the same way Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this problem
I need some more time to fix this So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone
Let's take some time to talk this over
You're out of line and rarely sober
We can't depend on your excuses
'Cause in the end it's fuckin' useless
You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long I remember shots without a chaser
Absentminded thoughts, now you're a stranger
Cover up the scars put on your gameface
Left you in the bar to try and save face You can only lean on me for so long
Bring the ship about to watch a friend drown
Sit out on the ledge, begged you to come down
You can only lean on me for so long
So sorry it's over, so sorry it's over
There's so much more that I wanted and
(So sorry it's over)
There's so much more that I needed and
(So sorry it's over)
Time keeps moving on and on and on
Soon we'll all be gone Man on a mission, can't say I miss him around
Insider information, hand in your resignation
Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found
Tight lipped procrastination
Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers)
Do you want to come to a party
My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30
This things at a frat house but the people are cool there
Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there
Would be someone there who would catch my attention
I wasn't out searching for love or affection
So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free
Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band
Someone in the background was doing a keg stand
This place is so lame all these girls look the same
All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed
In my bed back at home watching TV alone
Where I'd put on some porn or have sex on the phone
Far from people I hate down from anywhere state
Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there
With green eyes and long blond hair
She wasn't wearing underwear at least I prayed that
She might be the one maybe we'd have some fun
Maybe we'd watch the sun rise
But that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chests
And the things they suggest to me I couldn't believe what this lady was saying
The names she was dropping the games she was playing
She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly's
How she's down with the Iwise well constructed disguise
Now I'd rather go dateless than stay here and hate this
Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless
So I said I'd call her but never would bother
Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there
With green eyes and long blonde hair
She won't be wearing underwear and you'll discover
This girl's not the one and she'll never be fun
You should just turn and run because you'll find out that
Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard to impress
With the way that they dress
With those things on their chest
And the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard
Some girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again
The one where I wake up and I'm alive
Just as the four walls close me within
My eyes are open up with pure sunlight
I'm the first to know
My dearest friends
Even if your hope has burned with time
Anything that is dead shall be re-grown
And your vicious pain, your warning sign
You will be fine hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown
Like every single tree reach for the sky
If you're gonna to fall
I'll let you know
That I will pick you up
Like you for I
I felt this thing
I can't replace
Where everyone was working for this goal
Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back as pure as gold
To recite this so
hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin
Tonight
hey ohhh here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin
Tonight
hey yo here I am
And here we go
Life's waiting to begin I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me
I cannot live
I can't breathe
Unless you do this with me hey yo, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go
life's waiting to begin (do this with me)
hey ohhh, here I am (do this with me)
Here we go
life's waiting to begin
Life's waiting to begin. With all of this I know now
Everything inside of my head
It all just goes to show how
Nothing I know changes me at all
Again I waited for this to change instead
To tear the world in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know With all of this I feel now
Everything inside of my heart
It all just seems to be how
Nothing I feel pulls at me at all
Again I waited for this to pull apart
To break my time in two
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you
I'm always wanting you Use me Holly come on and use me
We know where we go
Use me Holly come on and use me
We go where we know She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting
She's all I need
She's all I dream
She's all I'm always wanting you And all again I wait for this
To fill a whole, to shake the sky in two
Another night with her
I'm always wanting you
Another night with her
But I'm always wanting you Been gone a long time I kinda lost my way, can't find you
And I caught a short ride to the grave and back this season
I can try to get by, but every time I start to panic
I'm a little bit shy, a bit strange and a little bit manic La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks, and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land On the narrowing line, what a way to sort my troubles
In a very short time, gonna pop, better duck and cover
Can you figure me out? I got caught like a little kid stealing
Did I say it too loud? A bit hard or a little misleading La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da La da da da, da da da da
La da da da, da da da da da I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land I went to a wishing well, I sank to the ocean floor
Cut up by sharpened rocks and washed up along the shore
I reached for a shooting star, it burned a hole through my hand
Made it's way through my heart, had fun in the promised land Everyone wants to call it all around our life with a better name
Everyone falls and spins and gets up again with a friend who does the same
Everyone lies and cheats their wants and needs and still believes their heart
And everyone gets the chills, the kind that kills when the pain begins to start Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night Everyone's cross to bears are the crown they wear on endless holiday
Everyone raises kids in a world that changes life to a bitter game
Everyone works and fights, stays up all night to celebrate the day
And everyone lives to tell the tale of how we die alone some day Let me get this straight, do you want me here?
As I struggle through each and every year
And all these demons, they keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night
They keep me up all night I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
(I had sex with your mother) night alone Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see (just you wait and see)
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
Night alone Thanks a lot you guys!
Hey kids, it's Satan. Thanks a lot for coming on down to
The show tonight. Hope you all had a great time. I know I did
Those Blink fellas sure put on a kick ass show, huh. Hope to see
You all at the after show party. I'm gonna start sucking dicks
And squeezin' titties, maybe I can put my peepee in your mouth
I love it when the kids come on over and I get, I have them suck
And kiss my peepee tenderly and gently. I like it when the kids sit
On my lap, and talk about unicorns and flowers and things like that
Maybe I'll even suck their blood. See ya kids later! Hey, how you guys doin' up in the back? Now from the top balcony
Can I get an Amen? Now from the floor, can I get a Hallelujah? Now from
All these other assholes, can I get an oh yeah? On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on I learned a lot today
Not sure if I'll get laid and
Not sure if I'll fail or pass
Kissed every girl in class
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large Sip a drink of the alcohol
End up kneeling in bathroom stalls
Eyes are red and my movements slow
Too high, got vertigo He took a shit in the bathroom tub
And fed the dog brownie drugs
Tried hard not to get caught
He fucked a chick in the parking lot On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large Break a window and bust a wall
Making fun of your friend's mom
Turn the music up way too loud
Charge the pizza to the house
Everybody would waste it all
To have a summer that they could call
A memory that's full of fun
Fucked up when it's all done On and on, reckless abandon
Something's wrong
This is gonna shock them
Nothing to hold on to
We'll use this song
To lead you on
And break the truth
With more bad news
We left a scar
Size extra large It'd be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
It would be nice
To have a blow job
From your mom My Dearest,
I've missed you very, very much since that last night we were together, and will hold that night especially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately.
I've read your letter through at least four times, and will probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I've wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself.
I keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don't look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess.
I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won't be too much longer until I'm able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I'm sick of always hearing
All the sad songs on the radio
All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy
That he's lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show
We would stay up all through the night
We would laugh and get high
And never answer the phone I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
'Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life I'm sick of always hearing
Sappy love songs on the radio
This place is fucking cursed in its plague
And I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can't forgive
Can't forget
Can't give in what went wrong
Cause you said this was right
You fucked up my life I'm kicking out fiercely of the world around me
What went wrong I'm kicking Don't wanna hear the static on the TV screen
Don't wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing?
Where did I go wrong?
Sometimes I just don't know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days You're not the only one who grew up feeling scared
You're not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone's gone missing
Everyone's done wrong
Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up You're giving up
We're getting out
We were young and we're not growing up
We're not growing up Save yourself where I was saving
We're not the same, we're two in a million
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
We've gone through hell, the battles we fought 'em
We stood as one, the young and forgotten
These are the good old days
These are the good old days These are the good old days
These are the good old days These are the good old days
These are the good old days Last night it came as a picture
With a good reason, a warning sign
This place is void of all passion
If you can imagine it's easy if you try
Believe me I failed this effort
I wrote a reminder this wasn't a vision
This time where are you Houston
Is somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you My head is made up of memories
Most of them useless delusions
This room is bored of rehearsal
And sick of the boundaries
I miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
This time I don't want to
Should I go back should I go back should I
I feel alone and tired
Should I go back should I go back should I
I hope I won't forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go
They question who we used to be
Sometimes I feel like I'm the oxygen between
The cigarette and gasoline I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh)
Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors
I read the sadness on your face I can't sleep 'cause what if I dream
Of going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (can't go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear
All of the pain and the fear
Your secrets filled up my ears
Like the ocean blue
I never wanted to know
How deep these cuts on you go
And like a river they flow
To the ocean blue Going back to San Diego
We bought a one way ticket
So we could go see the Cure
And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot
And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego)
Can't go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can't go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now
(I'm feeling this)
The air is so cold and numb
(I'm feeling this)
Let me go in her room
(I'm feeling this)
I wanna take off her clothes
(I'm feeling this) Show me the way to bed
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the way you move
(I'm feeling this)
Fuck it it's such a blur
(I'm feeling this)
I love all the things you do
(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here
Turn all the lights down now
Smiling from ear to ear
(I'm feeling this)
Our breathing has got too loud
(I'm feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor
(I'm feeling this)
Show me the bathroom mirror
(I'm feeling this)
Were taking this way too slow
(I'm feeling this)
Take me away from here
(I'm feeling this) Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again after you came and went
How can you say you meant anything different
To anyone standing alone on the street
With a cigarette on the first night we met Look to the past and remember her smile
And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time
Your smile fades in the summer
Place your hand in mine
I'll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time
(Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer
(Your smile fades in the summer)
Place your hand in mine
(Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna
(I'll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time
(Fate fell short this time)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Place your hand in mine)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
(Are we alone do you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Are we alone do you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time
(Are we alone do you feel it)
Your smile fades in the summer
(So lost and disillusioned)
Place your hand in mine
(Are we alone do you feel it)
I'll leave when I wanna
(So lost and disillusioned) I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na I woke up in the pouring rain
West Side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you, you really got me now
Black sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell onto the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Sober
Sober I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober)
Naa, na na na na na naaaa
Na na na na na na (when I'm sober) All the small things
True care truth brings
I'll take one lift
Your ride best trip
Always I know
You'll be at my show
Watching, waiting, commiserating Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Late night, come home
Work sucks, I know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on, my little windmill Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill
The night will go on
The night will go on
My little windmill Please take me by the hand
It's so cold out tonight, I'll
Put blankets on the bed
I won't turn out the light, just
Don't forget to think about me and I
Won't forget you
"I'll write you once a week," she said Why does it feel the same
To fall in love or break it off
And if young love is just a game then
I must have missed the kick off
Don't depend on me to ever follow through on
Anything but I'd go through hell for you and I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me I'll think about the times
She kissed me after class
And she put up with my friends
I acted like an ass, I'd
Ditch my lecture to watch the girls play soccer
Is my picture still hanging in her locker? I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful I haven't been this scared in a long time
And I'm so unprepared so here's your valentine
Bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody
This world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
His issues make my mind ache
Want to make a deal
'Cause I love your little motions
You do with your pigtails
What a nice creation
Worth another night in jail He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to Slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag So all you little ladies
Be sure to choose the right guys
You'll come back to me maybe
I'll shower you with lies
Got a lotta heart ache
He's a fucking weasel
Decisions make my mind ache
Want to make a deal Ease away the problems and the pain
The girl chose the one guy who makes you want to kick and scream
All along, you wish that she would stay
Fuck the guy who took and ran away He's a player, diarrhea giver
Tried to grow his hair out
When friends were listening to slayer
I would like to find him Friday night
Hanging out with mom and trying on his fathers tights
Life just sucks, I lost the one, I'm giving up she found someone
There's plenty more, girls are such a drag Fuck this place, I lost the war
I hate you all, your mom's a whore
Where's my dog?
'Cause girls are such a drag Eyes are, open words are spoken
Here's to the sunrise
Head is loaded cards are folded
Under the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
We woke up sober?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
You ran me over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder Mind is open, thoughts are woken
There goes the sunrise
Heart is broken, love unspoken
Here comes the moonlight Can you remember, you remember the last time
I left hungover?
Can you remember, you remember the last night
That I stayed over? Are we halfway gone or halfway there? Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Left alone
We're only halfway home
Sink like stones
Fall into the unknown Break me down, I'm not afraid of you
Pull me under
Slowly drown, I never wanted to
Left alone to wonder (Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh)
(Whoa-oh-oh) we're left alone (whoa-oh-oh) Josie, you're my
Source of most frustration
Forget when I
Don't meet expectations
Everything you wished came true
In the end we all blamed you
Even though, as they all know you weren't the only one, two, three, four Why do you still keep it around
When you know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And I know that you dated other guys
But I gotta wonder why you'd leave it out for me (shit!) Why am I still hanging around
When I know it brings me down, I'm hating everything
And you are getting rides home in his car
You're making out in his front yard, I'm hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And if we can have another day
I've got so much left to say, I'd tell you everything
And I'll laugh when I think about the past
When I see you after class, you're hating everything Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na)
"I just forgot you were there" (na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na) Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? Please don't remind me, put your past behind me
It shines so bright it blinds me, I wish that this would end
And I am not fine, last night I saw you online
Your screen name used to be mine, why can't we just pretend? And she said, (na na na na na) Can you read my thoughts, I'm not sure what I said
I feel dumb and long night coming Did you steal my prayers I don't know where I was
I feel numb and all or nothing
(All or nothing) It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend I can feel my head falling off my neck
I need something
To keep going So just take my hand
Only seconds left
The clock's running
Our time's coming Aaah! It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend It's Friday night let's lose our minds in a downward spiral
Here we go
'Cause we got no control
(No control) It's Friday nights always save my life from the worst of times we ever had
Thank God for punk rock bands Till Monday morning strikes again
We are the kings of the weekend This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) I'm so lost
I'm barely here
I wish I could explain myself
But words escape me
It's too late
To save me
You're too late
You're too late You're cold with disappointment
While I'm drowning in the next room
The last contagious victim of this plague between us
I'm sick with apprehension
I'm crippled from exhaustion
And I dread the moment when you finally come to kill me This is the first (thing I remember)
Now it's the last (thing left on my mind)
Afraid of the dark (do you hear me whisper)
An empty heart (replaced with paranoia)
Where do we go (life's temporary)
After we're gone (like new years resolutions)
Why is this hard (do you recognize me)
I know I'm wrong (but I can't help believing) Crossed the street
Naked at night
Bent over to show some moonlight
Pulled out some beer and gulped it down
Nude in a gutter is how I was found
Thrown in a police car and the door slammed
No noise just silence as I screamed my dick was jammed
Now in prison for one month no one to see
All I got is this guy Ben Dover Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude, I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs Went to a farm to tip some cows
Forgot that I left my pants down
Bent over to pick them up
Felt a twelve gauge next to my shit
The farmer took me to his house
Showed me the closet from the inside out
The police came and took me away
Saw Ben Dover again and he's still gay Don't like hesh-don't like rap
Kicked ol' Sally cause she's fat
I'm a jerk I'm a punk
Took a shower cause I stunk
Smoked a bong killed a cat
Had my nuts attacked by rats
Dad got nude-I wore a thong
For a hobby I make bombs When the clock strikes two,
There's just so much to do
And I can't explain what I need
Jobs and social groups
Hearing the latest news
Keeping our reputations clean
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life
Again
The difference between east and west
Money is so much less
Not that I'm poor, just to fine
I wish that the clock would often just be stopped
And then we'd look
Into the time
And I, don't want to worry
About being on time
I've seen the way you hurry
And time runs your life I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitudes a reason to die Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see
As school life is a
It is a woken dream
Aren't you feeling alone? I guess its just another
I guess its just another
I guess its just another night alone Let's get started, the faint and broken-hearted
Hold it up, I've got something I cannot hide
Worst painkiller, that all-in filler
The apart and departed look in my eyes Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow
With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night
Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers
Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind Sad, how far you ran, I'll search this land
Up through the clouds then back here
We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb
At all hours I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight I'm empty like the day after Christmas
Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye
You left me on the day after Christmas
There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight There's nothing left to say, and so goodnight
Goodnight There she was like a starry night
Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes
And a heart of steel always on her own
Almost never real
When the night will begin
The pain it won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love
And she was like a blade of ice
Like a lonely road clears day of life
Always sharp and cold always beautiful
I am such a fool When the night will begin
The pain won't end even if she falls in love
Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack
Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right
Even if she falls in love and it isn't so bad it's
Driving you mad even if she falls in love There's a cynical feeling saying I should give up
You said everything you'll ever say
There's a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring
Anxiety's calling in my head Is it back again?
Are you back again? Don't wake me up before you leave
Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh)
I feel your hand unlock the door
Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What's the point of saying sorry now
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out) What's the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry)
Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I'm not sorry now) Dear head, shut up
I can't listen no more
It's late, so shut up
Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house
You're superstitious
You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire
I can't sleep here no more
Too late and tired
Dreaming down on the floor I'm a haunted house
I'm superstitious
I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole
I'm barely standing on the ground
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again
With you, with you, with you, with you again I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down, I won't fall down)
I'm barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground)
All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all
I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won't fall down that fucking rabbit hole) Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above
Short of breath my long-lost love
I can't believe my eyes, are you for real? My life before was such a mess
There's no use dwelling on the past
My broken heart was in a cast
Then you showed up and it began to heal 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Someday
You'll come back to me
And I'll say
Something bitterly And you'll go racing toward the kitchen
Grab a knife, erase my vision
Take my flatscreen television
And my paintings by Marilyn Manson 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel 'Cause you're the only thing that matters
'Cause you're the only thing that's real
'Cause you're the only thing I'll never let go
'Cause you're the only thing I feel Six bottles went down the drain
One hours waste of time
I'd ask if you feel the same
Still pushing that chance to try
Your breath in this cool room chill
Long hair that blows side to side
You speak and make time stand still
And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever, and after Can't count all the eyes that stare
Can't count all the things they see
She kills with no life to spare
Just victims left to bleed
One drink and the pain goes down
Soft shadows lay by her feet
Lay soft as you slowly drown
Lay still while you fall asleep
(Fall asleep) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
(And after, and after, and after) Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me,
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after
Like violence you have me, forever, and after
Like violence you kill me, forever and after Push it out, fake a smile
Avert disaster just in time
I need a drink, cause in a while
Worthless answers from friends of mine
It's dumb to ask, cool to ignore
Girls possess me but they're never mine
I made my entrance
Avoided hazards
Checked my engine I fell behind I fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy Remember when I was in
The grocery store, now's my time
Lost the words, lost the nerve,
Lost the girl, left the line
I would wish upon a star
But that star, it doesn't shine
So read my book, with a boring ending
A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm a fuckin' boy She makes me feel like it's raining outside
And when the storms gone I'm all torn up inside
I'm always nervous on days like this like the prom
I get too scared to move cause I'm still
Just a stupid, worthless boy She didn't mean to deceive you, believe me
But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had
Now only came to this
And although she saw the mark
The arrow missed It isn't exciting reciting the stories
Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs
And both playing in punk rock bands
The start was something good
But some good things must end And she said, "It could never survive
With such differing lives
One home, one out on tour again We may never come back
The strike of a match
The candle's burning at both ends." And now she knows too much
And I'm too fucked up
It's awkward trying to make my move I'll pretend that I'm fine
Show up right on time
But I know I'll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back
I just wanted to hold on
But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy
Trapped in the body of a man and I'll take what you're willing to give
And I'll teach myself to live
With a walk-on part of a background shot
From a movie I'm not in She's so important
And I'm so retarded And now I realize
I should have kissed you in L.A.
But I drove home all alone
As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from?
What are you running from?
Is it so hard to see? And if you're feeling scared
Remember the time we shared
You know it meant everything (everything)
You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago
We might have had it all
But I was so stupid then
You needed time to grow
But now just as things change
As well my feelings do
In time things rearrange
I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
A I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night You have your other friends
They were there
When you cried
Didn't mean to hurt you then
Best friends just won't
Leave your side But what do I get
'Cause I just seem to lose
You make me regret
Those times I spent with you
And playing those games
As I wait for your call
And now I give up,
So goodbye and so long It's not a change of pace
This time I'll get it right
It's not a change of taste
I was the one there last night When I needed you most
When I needed a friend
You let me down now
Like I let you down then So sorry, it's over
(Ah) One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on / but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried
so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
One thing / I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart
What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter I saw you again
I think you used me again
Should we try this before we give up and move on
And pretend to restore what we have and hold on
At times like these
It's obvious
I saw you again
I know you fucked him again
Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge
Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these
It's obvious
At times like these
It's obvious I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again
There's some room to move on, to move on, to move on
And I saw you again and again and again
How do we fix this if we never have vision Day in day out
Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down
Day in day out
It's the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown
Whoa
Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge
Whoa
Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home
(I'm never coming, I'm never coming) Come down
I've been awake for days
Knocked out
By the sound of falling rain
Come down yeah we'll watch the sun just burn away the sky
Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, when will you save me
Los Angeles, I'm never coming home Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends
Wake me when this war is over
Meet me where the skyline ends Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles when will you save me
Los Angeles I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home
I'm never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba]
Late at night on mercy street
The summer air is way too sweet
The way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach
Something inside is incomplete
I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time
I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus]
The tidal wave and aftermath
I'm seasick from the years we've passed
Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin
She said goodbye and left again
These empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time
I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba]
Life's so strange
Time won't change
The world slips by, I'm afraid that she never gave much anyway
Life's so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)]
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home) (The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
(I'll take the last train home)
The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for
(The last train home)
