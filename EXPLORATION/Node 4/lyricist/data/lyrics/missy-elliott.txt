Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Cris
Nobody paid him any mind
No one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap
No one lifted a hand
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold
Seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone
Three years later
Steeped out the swamp
With ten and a half gators
All around the world on the microphone
Leaving the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen
Never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect you'll give me
Ludacris I live loud just like Timmy
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache and it's not from tumors
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed so I never let the bed bugs bight

Core to the right

Please, little one, please
You know my rhymes get tight
When I smoke all night [Chorus] We high tech like Timbo's
Slap faces of dirty hoes
N-Y-M-B-A
Dirty combo when we play
Swirl like the milky way
Deep like my black hole
I oppose, to expose
Chemical gases up your nose
Fade away like ozone
Quazars, moves and shit
Hey yo Missy, where da clip?
I think I need a hit
Shitty bees up in da place
Wanna be down with whoever
Be all up in his face but aint even on the level
I pull your wig back
Let of steam like nasty pools
That heat be to hot
Melt down, now up in pot
Count down, 3-2-1, lift off
Now over tize, Venus we circlize
And mars we tantalize
Comatize like Hale-Bopp
Smoking trees non stop
Then I send a televise from satellite on Night line
Yeah, wouldn't you like to get away
To the moon
We shine like stars
Lock down like metal bars [Chorus] [Repeat: x2]
My style is a one-in-a-million

C'mon! This is a Misdemeanor exclusive
If your radio is experiencing any kind of difficulties
Turn the volume up
Yes, turn the volume up
Yes, turn the volume up
This is an exclusive (Turn the volume up) It's very necessary, on the contrary
No you do not scare me, is you drinkin' Bloody Mary?
But shit, you betta hurry, before I have to bury
My attitude is bitchy, 'cause my period is heavy
I used to drive a Chevy, put twenties on that baby
My nigga was the shit, but then that stupid nigga left me
And now I'm lovin' Larry, but Larry go with Terri
And Terri is a freak, but it's his baby she will carry
The life he live's a fairy, cartoon like "Tom and Jerry"
My flow is legendary and your style is temporary
Yeah, you need to worry, like Jason, it gets scary
The words that I spit don't fit in that category
Is my vision blurry? My speech is very slurry
Me without Tim is like Jamaicans with no curry
And yes, it's necessary, so hurry, nigga, hurry
'Cause when this album drops, you whack MC's will all get buried [Chorus:]
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
Funky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
Funky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
Funky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up)
Funky fresh dressed to impress ready to party
Funky fresh dressed to impress (Turn the volume up) Your style's very crummy, that's why you have no money
You always looking bummy, I don't care if you don't love me
Don't try to come before me, unless you are a dummy
Repeat, you'll lose your teeth and I would hate to call you gummy
Rainy or sunny, battle no way, honey
This not a game of hide-and-seek, go call ya mummy
It's about get so ugly, and I'ma keep why'all runnin'
Hiding from me, 'cause you know you are weak
You ain't sayin' nothin', I keep it jumpin' jumpin'
In your Kenwoods, I'm bumpin' sumthin' in ya trunk'n
You can say I'm buggin', 'cause when I come out bustin'
That's why why'all be discussin' who I like and who I'm fuckin' [Chorus:] See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon
Fickidy, uh, uh, uh
See'mon, see'mon
See'mon, see'mon I had a little homie named Paul Revere
Smokes blunt after blunt, guzzled forties of beer
He would swear up and down every first of the year
He was gon' quit smokin', but he never did
Watch why'all huskey, it's about that time
Gettin' ready for the club 'round quarter til' nine
Couple bottles of hypnotic in the back of the ride
Might spit like a girl, but I hit like a guy
Me and Missy ballin' up the avenue
Funky fresh dressed to impress, we mackin' dudes
Music biz only reason I ain't jackin fools
You know bullshit walk and stackin' rules
Shit keeps drawin', the streets keep callin'
Drink til' I'm nice and uh, uh-uh, on'n
I'm bad luck, why'all mad 'cause why'all suck
Please do not try to fuck with young duck
Please do not try to fuck with young duck [Chorus:] This is, an exclusive.

Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop

Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props

My style of rappin
I'm such such a good rapper, I'm such a good rapper

My style the bomb diggy I'm calling your cards like Sprint
Can't be me, can't see me
I'm low like Timb, ladies and gents
Dogs, cats and babies
Whoever but my style
I hope you croak from the rabies
Swayze,maybe I call your name
Ain't that a fucking shame
I'm too high for that
I'm great like the dane
Mane on main
If you decide to put your hands
On my fucking light
Like the ciggarettes I light
You must burn, you better learn
From the pro
Who rock shows after shows
When it rains it pours
I hurt like the cold souls
My style polishes like nails and toes
You know, know [Chorus] You beg to be put on like cats
Nigga know who I am
Now you want to sing and dance
You want to shake your stanky ass
Well I'm sorry Sam
God damn, you ain't family
You hounding me, pounding me
With the same old story
You bore me
Lordy have mercy on all these groupies
Sorry cutie
Why you go and shake your bootie?
Cause there's only one Lil' Kim
The triple beam, the misdemean
Nigga queen, whoomp, we Tag Team
So hot we melt like ice cream
Without the dick riding
Dreams of smoking a California blunt
I got the lyrics to make you feel it
What you want nigga? I'm talking about my style
I am the fliest then RZA now
I'm talking about my style
Let me tell you about Missy's style [Chorus] Hey Timbaland be talking more shit

We out What you mean I don't need you no more
Cause I don't
I gotta bag full of toys and I don't need none of your boys
So you can hit every chick on the block
Cause I'm gone be alright once
I turn this power on ya dig Toys
You don't get the job done when I need a little loving
So I gotta do it myself if I want to feel something
So I grab me a toy 'lil boo ain't buggin'
Now I want some affection and you ain't giving me nothing A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl has a toy now baby
A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel (Uh c'mon!) I keep my butterfly close
When you ain't want to be bothered
Don't come waking me up
'Cause I ain't giving you nada
'Cause I got me a toy (Tooooy)
And it works for me and it lasts longer than the battery
So you best believe that A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl has a toy now baby
A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel (Uh c'mon!) I used to wish that you would love me
And fantasize on how we used to be
Until I discovered something better than you
I don't need no need your loving
You want to come home late at night touchin' And feelin' all over me
But I don't need no help in pleasing me
Oh! A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel
Every girl has a toy now baby
A toy every girl must have a toy
The way it make you feel (Uh c'mon!) How could I miss you baby
I didn't even know you was gone
It's obvious you aren't needed in the bedroom anymore
I'm just keeping myself occupied
Like all women do when they are taking a bath
And when you leave make sure
You don't slam the door because you fuck up my concentration Toy! [Chorus]
It's alright
As you may have heard
To smoke the fat one and let the thunder burn
It's okay, to play this loud
Mr DJ, don't mean to sweat you down
[Missy]
I stuck my fingers in the socket, I blew up like a rocket
in the market, now I cannot stop it
Oh mami, oh papi, why they envy me?
Messin up my creativity with all this negativity
so now I'm drinkin gin-and-seng
Anything to mess with my concentration with hallucinations
of invasion, from waiting on the nation
to get with my style
Cos I'm about to transmit into some funky ish
Can you get with this?
Zay, villaveu, yes, ugh!
They ask me if I'm nasty, they ask me, they bet me too
Like osh-kosh-bigosh, osh cock suck their cocks
Osh miss Miss iss oh shit
I gets mad styles, get it get it
I'm wit it wit it if you wit it, oh shit then let's split it
into a 20 sack, and I'ma be back
wit my boy Craig Mack like that, ugh!
Chorus
[Craig Mack]
Don't sweat me down
This jam needs a frontin MC, leave MC's shakin in the ground
Here come the bumpenin sound
Worth more than the coke that they sellin by the pound
I walk the street like Shaft
Hop to kick a paragraph, floatin on the funk like a life raft
Down with Sista, it's the MC brezzle twister
Mackalicious boy I'll pop you like a blister
Craig Mack's a Jedi Knight with The Force of course
I can run MC's thru my teeth like dental floss
So back up and don't sweat me down
Boo docks on locks, fat boys nabbed the home town
And you can get the balls like that
Hittin wicked like the funkalicious rhymes that's phat, uhh
And we can get back in forth off the back
Chorus
[Missy]
Oh if, I could bring sucker-suckertash
When I farts I poops cash from my ass
Cos If You Think You're Lonely Now
like Bobby Womack in gangsta format, I dunk shit like Shaq
I'm not greedy, I feeds the needy, I smokes a beady
I feel, the need to stroke the weedy
Oh big daddy, is you ready *slurp*
to slurp me in your mouth like spaghetti?
Hi Ho Silver, ya killer, my drug dealer
fo' reala, I drinks some Miller, ugh
Look up in the sky ARGH ARGH!!

From the places I've come
Sad songs I've sung
All the times I've been stung
For you bring the worst out of me

And I can't down these tears I've cried
The heaviness inside
Left me so petrified
Tried ta keep love alive
But I became too tired
'cause you bring the worst out of me (Eh, eh, eh, he hey) [Bridge:]
I wish I could change the way things have gone
And start life anew and now maybe once again
I don't know anywhere but something must've went wrong
And all I can say [Chorus]
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me) And I compromised all my time
And rearranged my life
To make sure you was fine
'cause our love was on the line
And I became so unkind
'cause you brought the worst out of me
(You brought the worst out of me)
This is (this is) how the story goes
Those ones who know
When its out of control
You work (work) and you work (work)
And some one gets hurt
And I guess that be me (When I sing)
When I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you
But look what you've done to me (me) (Eh, eh, eh, he hay) [Bridge] (When I sing)
Is when I sing this song
I get so teary eyed
'cause you get under my skin
Can't let you suck me dry
I was gonna marry you, have kids for you,
Stay true to you, live life wit you

You hear my gats in yo back (blat-blat-blat)
Huh, like spaghetti
Half of y'all MCs be stinkin' like boobetti
So your record label cut you off like confetti
They you wanna call Missy and beg me, (who) ooh beg me beg me
Dag I'm very scary
Burn a whole club down like I was Carrie
Give a boy French kiss, he wanna marry
See y'all jealous tricks, y'all cannot stand me
Ooh, that's fine and dandy
Hey daddy-daddy
Why these chickenheads, ooh they be so petty
Hey nah nah nah, you best not test me
I keep tellin' you nah you never ready
Nah you never ready [Chorus:]
Get rowdy
Let me hear y'all loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see y'all work it and work it till y'all can't stand up
Get rowdy
Let me hear y'all loudly
Keep my high niggas 'round me
Let me see y'all work it baby, work work it baby what! [Missy]
In the club, I see niggas
They think I'm super fly, they blow me sugahs
So I cut them short like some scissors
They trying to take me home, they give me liquor
You know who I am, I'ma bitch
Do you know what I make, filthy rich
Do you know what this mieans, gotta gat
I thought you was a freak, never that
You see me on the road, when I stroll
I float through the toll, like whoa (beep beep)
You just a silly hoe, this I know
You be at every show, for the dough, hear me now (what!) [Chorus] [Timbaland]
Yo, this is Timbaland
Callin' from the Matrix y'all
And this how we do it
Yo Missy, tell 'em how you feel, what [Missy]
Beat biter, dope style taker, originator
Or just an imitator
Stealin' our beats like you're the one who made 'em
Timbaland's the teacher and I'm the one who grades 'em
Check the verbatim, F is how we rate 'em
How dare you make 'em, jus like we made 'em
And I wont play 'em, and I won't say 'em
Save this for later, so I can tell you straighter [Chorus] [Missy]
Now see this one right here (ooh)
This is for everybody (ooh)
This is for my people east (ooh) east, west, south
East (ooh) west, south (ooh)
But you know what before I get up on outta here (ooh)
I gotta say one thing to y'all beat biters (ooh)
It's 'bout to be the year 2000 (ooh) you know what I'm sayin'
And I'm kinda sick of that (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
That (kack kack kack kack ficky boom ficky boom)
On everything y'all gotta come up with
Y'all own creativity, y'all own originality, y'all own style
You know what I'm sayin'
Hehe, you gonna be left behind this time
Alright ain't no love lost
All need you to do is stop beat bitin'! [Timbaland]
That was Missy
Now this is Timbaland signin' off from the Matrix
You heard that Basically, can't fuck with me I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
Records hey so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggas is decaf I stick 'em for the cream
Check it just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Color clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and coming for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pulling niggas files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin' Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin' mind now I got mine I'm Swayze Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real And when I was a lil' stereo (Stereo)
I listened to some champion (Champion)
I always wondered (Wondered)
Will now I be the number one (Tical hahaha)
Now you listen to the Gargon (Gargon)
And the Gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (Test me)
Me gwanna lick out them brains (It's like that) Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
The only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
Off the set comin' to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin' from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin' through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin' on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
Nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin' 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo' What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real I'll fuckin', I'll fuckin' cut your kneecaps off
And make you kneel in some staircase piss I'll fuckin', cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin' but sleepin' pills You motherfuckers
(So) So fuck the hoe

Gimme that funk, mmm
Funk, mmm
Yo gimme that

Yo, yo
Beware of the dogs, off the chain
Fuck your whips at the club we piss in the parking lanes
Blow it up ten frames so you see it wide
If your broad ain't fucking she don't need to ride (beat it)
She can crawl in the trunk with her knees inside
By the spare, she hungry I'll feed her fries
Cause I'ma, dog nigga, shot-call nigga
My shotgun talk with a lecture hall scripture
Applaud bitch, shake that ass
I getcha, drunk and high and duct tape that ass fast
Then leave you on your daddy front lawn (ding dong)
With your hair all fucked up, with one pump on
Get stomped on, I take the money and run
I'm a dog, shit I fuck right in front of your son
If you ain't got Missy and Meth
Want me to spit the hot shit for you? Nigga, write your check [Missy]
When you come home from work, I'm gon' make you do more work
Pour some wine in the cup, sip sippin on sizz-urp

Hands where your Stove Top be stuffing

Cousin tried to tell me pussy come a dime a dozen
And when it come around I'll beat it down like percussion
