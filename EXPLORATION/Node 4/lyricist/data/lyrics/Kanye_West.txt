Aww man you sold your soul
Naww man mad people was frontin
Aww man made somethin from nothin
Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say
Im on fire ay thats what Richard Pryor say
And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon act phony or who gone try to embarrass ya
Imma need a day off I think Ill call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Cause Im richer and prior to this shit was moving free base
Had a conference with the DJs Puerto Rico three days
Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay
Sorry Im in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had they shut down Prive
Aint that where the Heat play Niggas hate ballas these days Yep
Aint that like Lebron James Aint that just like D Wade Wait
On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God

Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme

You love me for me Could you be more phony
Damn Yeezy and Hov where the hell ya been
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen

The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us

Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove
Im in the twodoor true that niggas telling me You back
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it you talk it I live it
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
No paper ho but you can have some more of me
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM nigga
Me and Jigga
And a nigga still young thats why I have no kids
But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing
Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
Closed eyes see things

Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton

You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace

Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is

Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method

Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct

Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends

And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out
Wake up Mr West Mr West
Mr Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
I mean damn did you even see the test

Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm X buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang
Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student
Some people graduate but be still stupid
They tell you read this eat this dont look around
Just peep this preachers teach us Jesus
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
After all of that you received this
Im the one baby yeah Im the one baby
Since God gave his only begotten son baby
Its hard preachin the gospel to the slums lately

You on a run baby you on a run baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds baby
You think you me but you aint me what you done lately
Mhm thats cool but I been runnin on the sun baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson Jackson Jordan Michael Phelps
Yeahhh had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip Yeeeaaaalmmp
Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Wont even get pulled over in they new V
The good life lets go on a living spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life it feel like Atlanta
It feel like LA it feel like Miami
It feel like NY summertime Chi
Ah Now throw yo hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Yall pop the trunk I pop the hood Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass I got to look sorry
Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who aint on TV
Cause they got mo ass than the models

It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay this is the good life Welcome to the good life
Homey tell me whats good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood Welcome to the good life

The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could
But but I dont think he should Welcome to the good life
told me go head switch the style up
And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her Get away 
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
All∆í√Öhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi‚àö¬±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc‚àö¬©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year Chicago had over caskets
Man killings some wack shit
Oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
The church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
Pink slip on my door cause I cant afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
You sweat her and I aint talkin bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I aint talkin bout Cool J
See me at the airport at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
Brother Numpsay groupies say Im too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays I still have it my way
Yall dont want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
Ill show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin over babysitters like bitch its yo turn
Damn Ye itd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is superofficial
RRRRoc pastel with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride throw a movie on

Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on gone
Uhuhuh uhuhuh uh uh onnn uh uhuh onnn
Uhuh onnn uh uhuh
Im ahead of my time sometimes years out
So the powers that be wont let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunts house
Yeah I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me Benz or Rover
Man if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheapass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteenyearold
Sell drugs or get a job you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I cant believe it when I look up in the mirro
How we out in Europe spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got til its gone
I know I got it I dont know what yall on
Ima open up a store for aspiring MCs
Wont sell em no dream but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
Youll sell everything including the mannequin

Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life they souls and they songs
They said Sorry Mr West is gone
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said You going to school Ill give you a summer
Then she met No ID and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And Im rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess Im getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folksll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes damn
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This aint no fashion show mothafucka we live it
Ive been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think Im never wrong
You know what maybe youre right aight
You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It aint happen yet
And thats what intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means
And Im back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And thats why Im
Seven oclock thats primetime
Heavenll watch God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
Im a star how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You wonder if youll ever find your dreams
If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up
Then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
So Im on break next to the No Smokin sign with a blunt in the mall
Takin my hits writing my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doing beats a day for summers
Thats a Different World like Cree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
Im just waiting on my spaceship
Nnnnow my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets I got the bounce like hydraulics
I cant call it I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said Ise a loser I told her why dont you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me Im gonna follow
My heart and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks
You aint gotta guess whos back you see
Im so Chi that you thought I was bashful
But this bastards flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I dont usually smoke
But pass the dro
And I wont give you that money that you asking for

Cuz we dont wanna hear that weak shit no mo

Only adult man I knew that wasnt broke man
Flickin Starter coats man

We dont care what people say

Cause this summer they aint finna say next summer Im finna
Sittin in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Treys scholarship
Cause aint no tuition for having no ambition
And aint no loans for sittin your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin man your ass is grown
The second verse is for my dogs workin to that still hustle
Cause a nigga cant shine off
And everybody sellin makeup Jacobs
And bootlegged tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we dont care what people say
Momma say she wanna move South
Scratchin lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Round the same time Doe ran up in dude house
Couldnt get a job so since he couldnt get work
He figured hed take work
The drug game bulimic its hard to get weight
A niggas money is homo its hard to get straight
But we gon keep bakin til the day we get cake
And we dont care what people say
You know the kids gon act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of em dyslexic
They favorite Cent song Questions
We scream rocks blow weed park see now we smart
We aint retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my momma I belong in that slow class
Sad enough we on welfare
They tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
Im tryna get the car with the chromie wheels here
They tryna cut our lights out like we dont live here
Look what was handed us fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers go on call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we dont care what people say
My niggas
This is family business
And this is for the family that cant be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down know the answers in us
This why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your grannys picture
Now that youre gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas this cant be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man This Cant Be Life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate soul food know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side know how the family do it
When I brought it why the guard have to look all through it
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast
Who knew Id have to look at you through a glass
And look tell me you aint did it then you aint did it
And if you did then thats family business
This is family business
And this is for everybody standing with us
Come on lets take a family Grammy picture

And you dont wanna stay there cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you aint took a bath with your cousins
Fit in the bed if its of yall
Im talkin bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you aint have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
I woke up early this morning with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without using knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin sun
All my niggas from the Chi thats my family dog
And my niggas aint my guys they my family dog
I feel like one day youll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You aint got to get heated at every house warmin
Sittin here grillin people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin
The second she storm out then he storm in
Yall gon sit down have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isnt
We aint letting everybody in our family business
Yeah uh now Ima need you to kill the hypocrisy

Immature adult insecure asshole
And if you fall on the concrete thats your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan beat thats your last fault
Get what you ask for I swear that your ass low
She got a big booty but she couldnt drop that ass low
Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin money they be all up on your ass yo
When you gettin money cops dont let a nigga pass Go
Straight to jail yo in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer tell em I said Hello
Ask if Ima be there soon and tell him I said Hell no 
Yo what you say when your people get out of jail huh
Pour the champagne let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now Im in the Louvre lookin for fossils
Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells its so unCamry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh suits and Ferraris
Cute your shorty watch Barneys we head to Barneys
End up at Marni Giorgio service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year last year was magic
Lyrically cant none of yall murder Ye
Cause yall raps aint got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris raised the murder rate
First of all we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majestys swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin board when I am bored
All my homies GDs but I am Lord
Rap god Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Heres somethin that you could use in analogy
My life is like a childs illusions become reality
Can I talk my shit again
Even if I dont hit again
Dog are you fucking kidding
My hat my shoes my coat
Louis Vuitton stitch with Donatella Versace
Thats Louis Vuitton bitch
I think Hennessy I drank Im gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona Im zoning
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
Two years Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And Hey
Please dont start me
Im like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
Im pop the Barkers Im hood the Parkers
While yall was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rocachain instead of a wedding ring
Yall bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when Ye romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
Im on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
Its easy
The hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And oh yeah Yeezy
I did it for the glory
What am I supposed to do now
Man the game all messed up
How Im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego
I can stand there in a speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the night
The grind the empty bottles of NoDoz
Tank on empty whipping my mammas Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes shit that you dont floss
The Goyard so hard man Im Hugos boss
Why I gotta ask what that Tudor cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And Im asking about her girlfriends
Yeah the dark skined ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented em
When you meet me in person what do you feel like
I know I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know BIG and Pac you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Any one Big Pun Big L or Notorious
Till then get money and stunt and stay glorious
And Im gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
I miss the misogyny bad bitches massagin me
Sometimes we lowered our standards at the colleges
So please dont judge me uh for the followin
Fat bitches swallowin skinny bitches modelin
Take off that Givenchy and lets get raunchy
I have your face looking all Captain Crunchy
The devil stay testing cause when you chase the pussy its a sin
But if it falls in your lap its a blessin
Soon as I got salad I spent it all on dressin
French to be exact that Balmain was impressive
Hedi Slimane leathers
My homie Mali used to stay at th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me KRock so they would leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know hes the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers even more by polices
Howd he get the cash The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin he was stuntin
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout eighty
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See backback thenthen if you had a car
You was the ChiTown version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
Wed take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras we was hurtin em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin involved but dog
Fuck all that flirtin Im tryin to get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes homie
He told me dont rush to get grown drive slow homie
I do it for the forefathers yeah the street authors
That are now ARs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls thats way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my mans sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now theres crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wont make it to the family will
If I dont make it cant take it hope the family will
They aint crazy they dont know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty so its not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had
No electro no metro a little retro ahh perfecto
You know the demo your boy act wild
You aint get the memo Yeezys back in style
Now one room got Gidget the other got Bridget
Whats more tripped out dawg is they sisters
Nah you aint listen they black they sistas

So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelrys Egyptian know the hungers Ethiopian
Stupid questions like Is he gon be dope again
Have you seen him has anybody spoke to him 
This beat deserves Hennessey a bad bitch
And a bag of weed the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifes cursed well mines an obscenity
and and and and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head stop breathe get up check your weave
Dont drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and dont disrespect your seed

Whats scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss I forgot your name

Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set
Twista said Get It Wet
Ooh girl your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars

But I still mess with a big girl
If you aint fit girl Ill still hit girl

All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers gangstas all us ballas

But itd be wrong if I aint say nothin
Imagine if I aint say somethin
Wouldnt none these niggas say nothin

Yeezy might have to go and put his Louis on

Im not loving you way I wanted to
What I had to do had to run from you

And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know never never know

I cant keep my cool so I keep it true
I got something to lose so I gotta move
I cant keep myself and still keep you too
So I keep in mind when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you fore it finally got through
You lose you lose

See I had to go see I had to move
No more wasting time you cant wait for life
Were just racing time wheres the finish line

I bet no one knew I got no one new
Know I said Im through but got love for you
But Im not loving you the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll only God knows
If I be with you baby Im confused
You choose you choose
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Where I wanna go I dont need you
Ive been down this road too many times before
Im not loving you way I wanted to
Primetime basking in the lime

And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back

Better than a chick that say yes too soon
Until you have a daughter thats what I call karma
And you pray to God she dont grow breasts too soon
Projects to up gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off thats how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up
Get they first car and then IRS show up

Put and together and a little bad weather
Gon be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend was the strip clubs cool

Cause we takin these muhfuckers back to school
If you know this part right here feel free to sing along
I know its past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures
He claim her heart cant take the anaesthesia
Itll send her body into a seizure
That lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
Hey chick Im at a loss for words
What do you say at this time Remember when I was
Tell her everything gon be fine but I be lyin
Her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
Im arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandmas in the NBA
Right now shed be okay But since she
Was just a secretary worked for the church for years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together hes strong
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse Did you do the research
She asked me Can you sign some tshirts
Bitch is you smokin reefer
You dont see that we hurt But still
They outside of the emergency room room
You can feel my heartbeat beat beat
If she gon pull through we gon find out soon
But right now she asleep sleep sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
Let me see the Xrays I aint no expert Im just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus my Aunt Shirley Aunt Beverly Aunt Clay and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie its just One Thing
When they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam

To get there we run we fly we drive
Cause with my family we know where home is
And so instead of sending flowers were the roses
Imma get on this TV mama

Told em I finished school and I started my own business
They say Oh you graduated No I decided I was finished
Chasing yall dreams and what youve got planned

Shes got the same thing about me but more about us
Shes coming over so I guess that means Im her drugs
Just let me peek now I mean damn Im so curious
Shes got a lover so the lies and the lust is a rush
Times of the essence I need you to be spontaneous
Roll up the doja Henny and CocaCola
Then Im co coming over cause its never over
I see the emotion in your eyes that you try not to show
We get the closest when you high or you drunk or you blown
So I pour the potion so we could both get high as we could go
Then Ill get the lotion and do somethin to me when your thighs is exposed
Theres no turning back now I mean I dont mean to impose
Not now but right now I need you to undress and then pose
Im into that now catch a vibe when the doors get closed
Roll up the doja Henny and Coca Cola
And I keep co coming over cause its never over
Lift off lift off takin my coat off

Dude Fresh off the plane Konnichiwa bitches
Turn around another plane my passport on pivot
Ask for it I did it that asshole done did it

But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport havent I this year
They say he going crazy and we seen this before
But Im doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please how you gonna say I aint no Lohead
Cause my Dior got me more model head
Im insulted you should go head
And bow so hard until your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top MCs you aint gotta remind me
Top MCs you gotta rewind me
Im high up on the line you could get behind me
But my heads so big you cant sit behind me
And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
Id never do that to you at least purposely
We breaking up again we making up again
But we dont love no more I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights yall have a bad fight
And you talk about her family her aunts and shit
And she say Motherfucker your mommas a bitch
You know domestic drama and shit all the attitude
Id never hit a girl but Ill shake the shit out of you
But Imma be the bigger man
Big pimpin like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure its
And my niggas said I shouldnt let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently
But I been thinkin and it got me back to sinkin
And this relationship it even got me back to drinkin
Now this Hennessy
Its gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I cant even vibe with you sexually
Cause every time that Id try you would question me
Saying You fucking them girls disrespecting me
You dont see how your lies is affecting me
You dont see how our life was supposed to be
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you aint cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone you always be where them hos will be
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And all I got was a brand new sports car oh
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But I couldnt hear him all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong
My godsister getting married by the lake
But I couldnt figure out who Id wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
Driving around town looking for the best spot
For the drunk and hot girls
Up in the club look at here what we got
Some drunk and hot girls
Stop dancing with your girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talking bout your boyfriend since he is not me
Stop running up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunk and hot girl

A little time out might do you good might do us good
Before we be done for good

I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so

You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now youre here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Dont worry about what we cant control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry were closed
How we stop the Black Panthers
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that What Gil Scott was hearing
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that its like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it cut it measure it bag it
Sell it the fiends cop it nowadays they cant tell if
Thats that good shit we aint sure man
Put the CD on your tongue yeah thats pure man
From the place where the fathers gone the mothers is hardly home
And the Madigans lock us up in the Audy Home
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party holmes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood its a different type of chemical
Arm Hammer baking soda raised they own quota
Right when our soldiers ran for the stove cause
Cause dreams of being Hova
Went from bein a broke man to bein a dopeman
To bein the President look theres hope man
This that inspiration for the Moes and the Folks man
Shorty come and see his momma straight overdosin
and this is the soundtrack
This the type of music that you make when you round that
You cant buy this Superflyness like a shine is
Your Highness is performing look how long the line is
Its what happens when you make shit thats timeless
Its what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
Thats so novice Im so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasnt my place
The beats slow til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit but thats evident
And yall feeling it but I expected it
If its classic its gon last forever then
Im everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
Thatd turn my life to Stephen Kings
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like Im on parole
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Just looking at your history
Youre like the girl from Misery
She said she aint take it to this degree
Well lets agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her theres some things she dont need to know
She never let it go oh
Golly more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to pologize to Mos and Kweli probably
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali Mali
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain Carti lens and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped Id say somethin significant
But now Im rappin bout money hoes and rims again
And its still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
Whatcha gon buy next Whatever new trend it is
Im tryin to spend my stacks
And Im so broke I look back like Damn was I on crack
I mean twelve platinum chains was I on that
What the hell was wrong with me dog
Sing along with me yall
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a PhD a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin ripped off by guys like this
And givin head is like a whale thats usin a toothpick
Well Im in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for free
Later on I might charge for menage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it aint gon cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And Im still actin calm denamuhh
She asked Can you drive me in the hundreds where my Altima was
While we drive she tellin me bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin off dont get no rich nigga
Give ME some head thatll really piss him off
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the four dot six bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or til I go crash
Whatever comes first Im prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second Ill be there with my weapon
Pullin up in the Lexuses one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin me messages
K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed drink and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam
So say my name like Candyman
And Imma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you dont need a fix girl you gotta leave
You cant take that all at one time ya gotta breathe
Stop all your blood clot cryin I was flyin
Made it to school with barely nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm yeah I hear ya mom
Yeah yeah I dont wan be broke when Im
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr West theres no good classes and thats what yo ass get
Not even electives Not even prerequits
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds
Now Im in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muhfuckers underachievin
Man this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if Im too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo
Like old folks pissin I guess it all depends oh oh
Stop your cryin baby
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
Thats right thats right thats right thats right
And when you get back she gon start up a fight
That night that night that night
Baby its too late for that lately Ive been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos what would you do for a Klondike
Or two dykes that look Christina Milianlike
Hm Ill be on time for that
I aint thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo Ill be there in five minutes five hours later
Ill be there in five minutes go head ride with it
Im so live with it look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know its late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause Im finally here yeah
We gon to Mass today we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers dont even deserve a track from me
You see if you ever wanted to ever be anything
Thered always be somebody that shoot down any dream
Therell always be haters thats the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon have to take my life fore they take my drive
Cause when I was barely livin thats what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind fore Im out of my mind
And get some leeway on the he say she say
Your girl dont like me how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say Yo no hablo ingl‚àö¬©s
And everybody want to run to me for their single
Its funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasnt around when I couldnt feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldnt feel myself
Dawg if I was you Id kill myself
Made a mil myself and Im still myself
And Imma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now Ill speak from the heart yall all frontin
Everybody feel a way about K but at least yall feel something
Such an easy morning we on a ride
And Im feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They dont want black people to think and drive
I mean my whole team bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that its Fashion Week
And the weather wasnt barely hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott
Did I mention GOOD Music and forever we hot
Motherfucker are you ready or not
Merry Christmas to all and all a good night
Huh now we all livin the good life
Yeah though its forty below the wind chill
And we wipin snow up off the windshield
Its still wonderful night to be alive baby
And Im so happy Im with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin for the mall dont trip you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that You the star at the top of my Christmas tree 
My only question is Where my presents 
She said Shhh she got a gift for me that aint for the kids to see

All that talking is gon give me a Tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep Im tired of yall
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
See you know my style
Im very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said daddy thats the reason why you had me
Yep we was praticing
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though You my favorite accident
So go head pop some Cristal
For my newborn child cuz now yall
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grandparents on a field trip
And Im the little kid tryna touch the exhibits
But itll fade before I get to get a hold of that
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told Id know to laugh
Man man I wouldnt let a moment pass
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you dont really know cause you cant recall them
Its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
People you never got a chance to say bye to
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
Into real life real life if you try to
So close so close but so far so far
And so far so far no cigar no cigar
We cant dwell on the past all we got is today
So Imma live like its no tomorrow
No goodbyes
Her heels set the mood
Where did you acquire those Alaias
When I met you I heard Jesus bells strings and the choir
I got lines thats better than niggas albums plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that nuts I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks
We aint dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
Im trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I aint stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie
And if Im a douche then put me in your coochie
I swear they should have never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if Im trapped by the boobies booby trapped
They try to tell me my chain broke the levee
Maybe cause its flooded
Why you walk around with a baby crosss cousin
My teeth already white yall gon make me floss for nothing
My teeth real diamonds whats the cause of the fronting
Why yall got all caps on
Don Cheadle time get extra black on em
Burn Hollywood burn
Take too long for niggas to get they turn
Probably be cremated before I get my earn
They try to tell me that aliens built the Pyramids
I swear lifes a bitch on a period
For every inch they cut the nose off the Sphinx
I make my jeweler add a few more links
You can look at me tell I dont give a fuck what nobody think
And my face always looking like somebody stinks
Question what color was the skin of the man who beared the cross
No matter how many lashes they couldnt beat it off
How many Cassius will we see in one lifetime
Thats why its Miles Davis Kobe its Mike time
I keep that GOAT book on the ottoman
And wrote hooks about slaves that was slaughtered in the s
Yall forget that I got called nigga
On Twitter so many times yo I lived that
Now Im just tryna find where to raise my kids at
Cause they dont want niggas next to where they crib at
Hey realtor Im lookin for a nice park
Twelve noon she said my family gon make it too dark
This is the flow that solar eclipses
So hopefully one day that real soul will eclipse
The bullshit they got us listening to in this existence
Dont give up now just a little more persistence
I am the day Ice Cube met Michael Jackson
Keep him away huh Something might happen
This is the making of a masterpiece
So we broke out the chains and told the master Peace
I sold my soul to the devil thats a crappy deal
Least it came with a few toys like a Happy Meal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me lonliness
Get away from me fake bitches I cant take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
Im an only child lost in the World
Where do the lonely kids go when the bell ring
Its feeling like Hell rings
Bringing me back down
Checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didnt have the ends
I wouldnt have so many imaginary friends
Im spaced out Dogg I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
And we aint finna change so well never agree again
Till then Ill be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
I sold my soul to the devil
I know its a crappy deal
At least it came with a few toys
Like a Happy Meal
Im spaced out dog
I be on that moontalk
I wonder if God asked Mike how to Moonwalk
You know the entertainment Angels
Adriana for Giselle
Lets exchange Angels
Photoshoot at my crib
Lets exchange angles
Rockin nothin but them Tom Binns bangles
My heart so anxious gettin anxiety
Begging one of these fuckin fashion houses to hire me
They say Ive been an asshole
I said if you acquire me
I can be a quiet me call it verbal dieting
Give me your herbal chai tea
Ill be calm as Tai Chi
With a bad white bitch like IceT
Im not right dog Im slightly off
Im paranoid like bonin raw dog
And wakin up with a slight cough
Yea thatll make ya dick quite soft
Plus my neck hurt too lemme take all this ice off
Never meant to hurt you I shouldve had nights off
But it cost too much to live and I never took the price off
Dont let me hold you back I only hold you back
Were on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high
Sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet well teach our daughter ballet
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle
You wouldve been the best mom I would have been the best Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end Imma let Mos begin
You know what I figured out Im not a nice guy
I shook hands kissed babies gave it a nice try
You know what I hate pictures of other peoples kids
I hate plastic couches in other peoples cribs
I hate when other peoples cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
Whats the cause of the poor smell
She said I just cleaned up
Baby I cant tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score he took the charge
Oooh that shit gotta hurt
Its the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now she get her back blew out
She cant clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet Im going to sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her pen busted goddamn who brought the raccoon out
For the team
He walked in our lives I was only five
Superman pajamas I was super duper fly
Sittin there like why He at least HooperSize
You know I scrutinize like Who this newer guy
Im my mama boyfriend Im her little husband
I was the man of the house when it wasnt
Tryna get to know me homie Just kill the charm
You aint interested in me you just tryning to fuck my mom
We all the voices of our parents bad choices
The aftermath of divorces the kids of bitter splitups
And babysitters and grandparents dont know what do to with us
And the last thing I want to see is mamas new nigga
You old Old Spice wearing short chain wearing
Dress shoes and jogging pants wearing church sock wearing
When you first stop caring about your appearance
When you get here anyway I already got parents
Dont try to put me in line I already got crayons
My mama said I could do it I already got clearance
Keep your hands off my mama how Anita got Clarence
Yall I know she look good but you need to stop staring
I drew a picture of her thatd make her proud
But the door was locked and the TV up so loud
I screamed out I aint going to sleep no time soon
And when I do Im sleeping in my mamas room
Twenty years later where has the time gone
Now you see Im dating having problems of my own
Now that Im grown the tables turned around
I never thought Id ever raise another niggas child
He dont like his mamas boyfriend just like me
Dont wanna do the wrong thing thats very unSpike Lee
But he be like D Bo round his mama there
Cause when she here he be quiet when she leave he be talking again
He be wilding out be calm
I dont drink the drama or sip the DomTylerPerryon
You gonna marry my mom Look I dont read palms
And I dont read Psalms but I did take little man to church
Took little man to school
Look little man kids dont make the rules
Even though I aint raised you you your mamas angel
Dont get it twisted baby boy Ill Ving Rhames you
There must be more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimized
Thats why a lot of girls claim they aint into guys
And mess with other girls part time to improvise
I knew she wasnt bi
No I seen it in her eyes
But Im like any other guy trying to get in her thighs
She telling me about how black people should enterprise
And Im like if you dont get your ass in this ride from Enterprise
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by
With the gas fully filled up like I didnt drive
Told her I had a girl nah fuck it I didnt lie
Told her this rap game is alright Im just getting by
She had a lil weed and would get a lil high
And Im looking in her eyes and Im loving her vibe
Told me back in she fell in love with the Tribe
Boo back in I was just like you
Please dont be confused by the ice and jewels
Im like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Frees banging but shes no Rachel
Was it something I did wrong
Yeah I know Im wrong
Shes at home alone and Im always gone
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and Im at work yo
And she dont call a lot
And when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal Ill get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges strip club splurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And Im trying to break the banks cherry
Tryin to see can I afford Canaries
With a Ferrari and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from fifty gs to fifteen hundred in a week
No Im trying to callone ringtwo ringsseven ringseight rings
Her mother picked up the phone
Like she in school and she dont stay here no more
I guess theres more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband just minimize
I guess thats why she says she aint into guys
And focus on school fulltime to improvise
Somebody told me that Deltas brownskinned AKAs lightskinned
And they supposed to be bougie so they got white friends
First day of school Imma take you sight seein
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said I know what you about to say like your hypeman
Last year a nigga hit her and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her its frightnin but
Roll some think Ill roll some
To know some if we both honest
Who lasts yeah you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know whats mine when I see it
I know I know I know when I see it
Riding down the baby
Pacing thinking to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Dont know why but I know a sign when I see it
Yeezy Neyo the remix ayo
I think its time to hit em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny and I know its especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon question me
If she even stand next to me but you should laugh
Cause you my better half woman laughing
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so s
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the inch rim wheels looks so good with your inch heels

Gucci on aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury

Cause you in my soul and system
And we gon take her home with this one
I got something that you gon like
You got something that I cant fight
We got something that we both gon like
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam

And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me little homey I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you
And I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews Im representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talkin about Chitown
Get you a cute chick face got potential
Working with her little hips waist like a pencil
Know how niggas play you but you know how Ye do
Says she love Beyonce let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain says is that HeSus
If Im unfaithful blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift they all up in
She aint pregnant but about to have twins
Now is it real love I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them Ds
Walking down Melrose spot where they sell clothes
That chick know she bad tell by the Chloe bag
She aint no hoodrat she aint gotta prove that
I peep the McCartneys Stella got her groove back
Hold on lemme ask you why you spend your money on that shallow shit
Why dont you buy some bigger tits
Something thatll last you
I couldnt tell you if Halles really real
But Ima let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I dont need no hands to know Lindsey Lohan

Just look at what we got if we dont shoot the Reeboks
This is a beat that no flow can detox
So the respect is due like my Louie back

On the corner
Yo mad niggas got dreams of the Lexus and coupes
Got their signin bonus and bought TECs for the video shoot
Ayo them shits backfired before the cameraman arrived he died
For his image now lets start the scrimmage
In the first quarter I sacked MCs
By halftime you still got rhymes but they are diseased
They infected with seconds of life left
I cremate MCs and breathe they ashes in my lifes breath
In a life or death situation
I come through with the Chi representation
And bleed you pussies every month like ovulation
The sensationll shine through your mind
Take it line for line
Look I feel bad about the fact that you gotta creep with me
When your man be around you dont speak to me
When my girl be around I see you peepin me
When they both aint around you be freakin me
We used to do it secretly now you all talk
You tellin everybody like you wanna get caught
I think my girl catchin on cause my story keep changin up
You gotta stop callin up my crib and hangin up
Truthfully if you tellin people that you doin me
Then you tellin me that you dont even wanna screw with me
And thats a shame I cant even do my thing
You get dick and you go temporarily insane
You think its a game but I dont wanna play no more
You wanna stay but you cant stay no more
You wanna be with K but that aint okay no more
You got somethin to say but you aint gotta say no more
It seem like fine hoes is hard to find mostly
The type of girls that give you their whereabouts supposedly
And when you check they aint never where theyre supposed to be

Monica Lewinsky on the dress you take her to the cleaners

But it dont matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin relaxin shootin some pool and
Playing some bball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre

Victorias Secret show they miss me
Voices in my head I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH get out my fucking head

Flow is just the nicest
I admit the propane

And spit refreshingly
When I rock the stadium

You should bring a extra tee
Now Im standing next to Jay
Who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world
But youre here with me
Thats good for my ego
Me and my ego
And it go wherever we go
My ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league
One day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego
On a scale of one to ten what do you rate yourself
Heres some champagne hydrate yourself
I know Im lookin good you lookin great yourself
I mean you shittin on these bitches you should hate yourself

So thats a middle finger for you haters
I got my superman power my superman cape
These the last hours but superman late
The clock is ticking damn can you wait
Man will he come back and save the day
Fly across the earth put things in reverse
I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse
Certain things I cant doctor and you say Im the worst
I aint have enough patients but I needed a nurse
Thatll come by my bed late
See if my head ache
Then get my head straight
Then give my head great
Every time I popped up like the VCR
I took your breath away then we performed CPR
With all the cars the clothes the lights the boats
I guess I was just trying to sow my royal oats
In the penthouse position
With penthouse bitches
See I Pimpd My crib so I must exhibit
Shit these last years been a haze like Issac
So I close my eyes
Tighter than Asian eyes get
Realized I got the same wings angels fly with
Louis Vuitton feathers now that some fly shit
Verbal asked me do I need a pen
Not right now
Everything I write now
I dont even write down
I dont need her right now
But Im so bad
Ask her can she hold my gonads before they go bad
Since I did a song with Teriyaki I been acting very cocky
Using every opportunity to shit on everybody
If you heard Ill be in Houston like Bobby
Puffing on a blunt until the B got me body
There fees in the party
Chillin in the lobbies
Anything you heard happened yo it probably did
Full Force trying to find where the Party is
For the last time to kick it like Karate Kid
Man that line was way obvious
Way out of my jurisdiction of my high snob
On my job kill a nigga no prob type flow
Just seen a nigga get Rob like Whoa
Oh should have tucked your chain
Niggas aint playing man it aint a fuckin game
All that frontin for the audience
Make em not exist no more Yugoslavians
Ohhhhh ohhhh ohhh you too much pressure doll
You gon raise my cholesterol
I gotta lower the phone decibels
Just to talk just a thought
Imma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like reservoir and I was Mr Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink
I was choking you in a good way good way
Now we in the streets and Im chokin you in a hood way
When the cops come what I could say
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning Bossip Perez
Any girl I take out Mediatakeout I need a break now
Before I break now ah ah ah ah

You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson classy
Ohhh why she say that OUCH

On that same couch casting
Now listen to TPain and sing
When you take the picture cut off your face
And cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC Serch til I reach rd Base
And when I get home Imma hit home plate
Wait could this be considered our first date
Ye the picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cooked coke cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
In Playboy mags like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian be a lady aaaaat it
You know whats a crazy thing
Some girlsll make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ Year Old Virgin

Dashiki kimono or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin my luck I hit her with the text say
Baby you up uestion mark
And she respond YESSSIR
Everybody saying please dont let go
I hear it over and over and over like a echo
I see it in my dreams I feel the effect though
People drowning in debt
Somebody to the rescue
Everybodys saying we need something special
Nah man we need something extra terrestrial
Outta this world speak for us
Be the vessel
Outta the box reach for it through the threshold
Uh through all of the stress though
Whats best of all people screaming like a festival
Just applaud this moment is special yall
We lost a four leaf clover

The crowd is open I think I know why
Im back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep Im still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldnt cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons
People asking him do you have any grey poupon
With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Cant wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chitown legends accept no imposters
And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was QTip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin fallin down I aint drunk thats my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level aint at my waist level
Im fly get on a plane jet lagged already
Im tired the Goyard bags is heavy
Im fire the flow hard as a Chevy

When see me with a CL like Pete Rock
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid

How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Yall be going through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep What do you think bout
If yall get a divorce
She gon take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club in the club tryna mingle
Meanwhile she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
Ay pimp its Ye pimp

They already recognize me from my gold chain
The same one I gave Keyshia Cole man
Now go dumb like Cole on Martin Im retarded

And if not
Then please keep your eye on me
These niggas is bringing out the worst side of me
When you wired me
You inspired me
To become the higher me
These execs
All want the details
How I made the world bounce like
Full messages on emails
But they hiding something like shemales
So
We still
Pull up in Sprewells
The ice and me chill
Like Goldmember I love gold
Whats the point to gain the world if you lose your soul
Now
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap white handle I got jungle fever
I went platinum
And I dont rap guns
My diamonds is whiter than Michael Jacksons
Me and Miri make music you can hold in time
So take a second to listen it may blow your mind
Ahh The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin Damn Ye snapped with this beat
Fuck you expect Ive got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels
Haters back down gotta be that steel
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal
Look how they did DAngelo ask em how do it feel
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God dont ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please dont ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
But its quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
Im somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess its messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
Im just gon check myself in again
Yeah history in the makin Do or Die
Yeah yeah uh uh uh
Me and Do or Die got maneuvers
Cold pimp tactics all in one package
Hollerin at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
Bigger that the jeans of the
Rap floor green
Thats how I gotcha
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Quit hollerin at them losers
And get with this shit that
Got his own business an entrepreneur
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
Lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks I done got Cnotes
So glad I aint take the drive to Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
Fuckin with my girl today around threeoh
My man said lets call some girls that we know
Ohhhhhhhh
Sometimes I wanna say fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me now feel so sick just because
They came over to cheer me up
Smoked drink and yeah we fucked
No matter what they do it cant be enough
Ever since I been flossin
My girls totally awesome
Girls wait to exhale
They dont breathe often
Claim that my game stone cold Steve Austin
Claim that I boss em
Basically Diana Ross em
But whos to blame for all these fights
When you aint always wrong
Im just always right
And I just always like
To see exactly how your face look
Right when I walk down that hallway right
When I pack my bags
When I got that cab
You never thought Kanye would ever got that mad
You acting like I aint the reason that you got that Jag
That you got that bag
Lets talk about amnesia
Yeah you got that bad
Kanye the best dressed nigga next to fags
And Im the best version of Mase next to Fab
And Imma call your best friend up just to stab
Cause of the way that you do
Mae said cmon Mike said chamone
Started up early like RavenSymon‚àö¬©
Keisha KnightPull Emmanuel
I dropped out of school with no manual
Nothin handed to dude but did I complain
Every time magazines try to taint my name
But yall cant hold me down like restraint
I took the T off out the word cant

Bush for sendin our fam to Iran
Im in the club with a henny ass in my other hand
Lord please forgive me Im just a man
Right now Im trying to make some adjustments
Before they do me like they did Janet and Just and em
Me and my cuz and them
Trying to rap like bust and them
And my clothes was busted and bummy
But I aint eva eva accept no money from these so called sponsors
They was in Benzes I was in Hondas
Now I wonder where they all at like Ananda
Hmm yea that something to ponder
The money I make on this ones for Donda
Thats West to you you the next
I cant hold my breath for you
What you need to do is turn it up some decibels
And put some more zeroes in front of that decimal nigga
Man how did she bring it up How did she break it down
Man you at the clinic Dog slow down thats your child
But if you keep it then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
Thats when she gon tell you to beat it
You know it aint yall little secret you famous you cant go nowhere
Cause everytime you go there its hoes there
So basically you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her Man dont say that
Matter fact like Pat dont say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on pay stacks
Things come up from way way way back
I go by the name Kanye Omari
And I wrote this just to say Im sorry
I have foreign cars and houses
I have porno stars and spouses
You tryin to stab one like Jack the Ripper
I was tryin to stab two like Jack the Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home he from the street
He gon want him some strippers
And Im a big tipper I dont need to be trippin
This my first Rolex it dont even be tickin
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without them clouding up in half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Basically mean Im into better things
I was an addict of cheating but I stopped before
You an addict you go with Janet Jackson you cured
Yeah Kanye to the yeah

I told her Im Nigerian a straight up nigga
Now is it just me or do them Uggs

Dont try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology

All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas tryin to figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year me or LeBron James
They say whoa dont get caught up in the hype
Aint no tellin they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night pop bottles fuck models
Spend money til you broke my nigga live your life
Now how the hell I end up arguing with this bitch aww
Know everything but dont know shit aww
Kinda reminiscent of Anna Nicole Smith aww
I just turn my music up like Damn thats some cold shit aww
I mighta known her bout a couple of months
Since then she gained a couple of chunks
She went from being a strobe light
To that old lady on Boomerang
Lady Eloise I need no lights
And I swear she a riot folks
How she order all that food and a motherfucking Diet Coke
He said You lying yo why is you lying yo
Cut it out quit it G you hurting my kidineys
Naw she talking bout a couple of kids for me aww
Shes hinting at a ring from Tiffanys
Right then and there I had an epiphany
I swear since that day Ive been treating fat hoes differently
Theres only one girl on my agenda
You talking bout Brenda
Naw Im talking bout Linda from last September
Now Linda love lace like Linda Lovelace
LaFace says she like Mase but she love Face
And I know that Linda was a hiphophead
And I know that Linda gave HipHop head
But I feel I could convert her
Cuz I aint here to hurt her mayn
And she was messin wit me when I was still at Burger King
She aint hop in my bed cuz of the whips and cream
Cuz when I had her in bed I had whip cream
Shakespearian midsummer night dream
I unzip things and pull out big things
They was flashin grgreen she was like chching
Got em but she know a rreeal nigga when she spot him
So now shes pickin dresses from Vera Wang
Scratchin out her maiden and heres my name
Now Im sittin at the bar wit all my guys
They sayin Cheers to you for your future years of pain
Like Dog you ready to give all this shit up
The summers on its way and these hoes doin situps
And when they see the way the G lights lit up
Youre gonna wanna have two like John Ritter
But naww I bought her a brand new BM
He said Dog slow down like Brand Nubian now
It cost Kobe seven digits to pay off Bridgett
And get acquitted and break that bitch off cause he aint did it
Here go the Henny swig it
You know its frigid
I got em chillin in the cooler
Break out the ruler

So many BIs so much inspiration
Hey miss

Im tryin to cut in the movies
Im tryin to give her something else to drink besides a smoothie
Niggas is jealous cause we in drops
The cops wanna stop us about every four blocks
Cause what we smokin them sacks got no seeds
And what they got in they pockets is no cheese
Now bring some more stacks
Before you ask
About the price of the tracks
The game on smash
Look
Dont change the facts about these plaques
Because in fact
My freestyle hours over powers
Brothers cant hack it
Sensitive to truth and mack bitch

From what I hear Kanye is killing the game very bad
My girl rocking the little lamb that Mary had
A l ittle bit of Ghosts style mixed with Mos style
Im versatile Im the poster child
Getting cheese so Im suppose to smile get it
We making hits like Sosa now hit it
And I hate when girls acting bougie as hell
And I already seen them naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gone make my kids be stupid as well
Well our father please forgive me
Im sinner slash winner slash soul inventer
Now if my man Benzino got a Benz and they call him Benzino
When I get my Bentley they gon call me Bentlino
A lot of shit changed since I hooked with JayZ yo
For the tracks charge around Cnotes
So glad I aint take the job at Home Depot
Right now my car and home would be repod
I broke up with my girl today around
My man said Lets call some girls that we know
Sometimes I wanna say Fuck my bitch
But I dont want nobody to fuck my bitch
Even if a modelin chick sucked my dick
It wouldnt make me not feel so sick
Just because they came over to cheer me up
Smoked drank and yeah we fucked
But nothin that they did couldve been enough
Now this weed drank got me faded
That Malibu is so underrated
She mad at me thats an understatement
I can just see your girlfriends hatin
Girl told you dont leave his ass
And when that nigga blow he gon leave your ass
But when he get low he gon need your ass
If he cryin callin bawlin
Yallve been together too long for all this name callin

Yeah we be makin up but when we makin up
All were makin up is the truth
Damn I know she love me oh

She could fight for my love like Aaliyah
Or write a four page letter like Aaliyah

And Ive done fucked up so bad that I cant go home

But her gear is bangin she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cause she was bad to the bone
She from a battered home she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to peep off she wanted to take a week off
Bustin Scary Movie nuts I had to get the freak off
That new Tom Cruise to the Moulin Rouge
On a too long cruise she said I aint bonin you
With them too long shoes and acted bougie in a Grey Poupon mood
So Imma act cheap in a coupon mood
She said Ye you dont love me
I told her it was good its too bad it got ugly
Listen yo

Brought back a couple platinum plaques on a plane
Brought back the soul to change the game
Had a little beef I had to aim its stainless steel
The lyrics in my heart I cant restrain they real

For every time a nigga told me stick to the beats
I could have ate at Cheesecake at least six times a week

Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe let it fly let it go
Let it fall let it crash burn slow
And then you call upon God

How could you love someone that hurt you played you spoke to provoke you
How could you love someone that burns you turns you into a werewolf
And in the moment you might do some things youre not aware of

You really want to know about a day in that shit
Go ahead and tell the DJ to play Swizz
So I aint gotta tell these hoes who I is
Bitches hatin again thats music to my ears
Whats you think my fuel was for all Of these years
Im inspired when people dont like me
It keep me writing so exciting
Man the drama is so enticing
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash thats cake and icing
I asked her you buying
She said no just sight seeing
Maybe thats just because you aint found the right thing yeah
Lookin out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin at the mirror wondering if its the same dude
Lookin at my closet wondering if its all about clothes
Look right next to me wondering if its all about
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
And I drive so fast I blur the light post
They say Drive Slow I say I know
Then errrr away I go
And the way I flew
In this year or two
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like Hey you might like this
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin me
Im his herrooh
I took his CD and asked him what hes lookin for
He said Man I dont know Maybe a miracle
Excuse me but this verse
Has not been Russell Simmons approved uhuh
You wont see it on Runs house uhuh
You wont see it at a nuns house
My New York nigga said he heard it at sons house
Talkin bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois maybe Im just bogus
Cause she dont want you to buy her a drank
Swizz said she aint got no money in the bank
And she be standin there cause its cameras
Tryin to show yo legs off you aint Amerie
If I fall in love a girl gon live on rodeo
Until that dayo she take the monorail
And I dont want no girl that will answer to ayo
Make it more harder make me put some work in
You get to flirtin play her just perfect
Fuck a drank Imma buy tha bar if ya worth it
Now I dont know what the hell this song is talkin bout
Do you
She said Yeah I been spendin all day tryin to figure that out
You too
The arms race made em raise they arm and race straight to the top
Who knew who knew
Right now they got that number one spot do you want that want that
Me too
One thing I gotta call out boy take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they aint black when they get money they dont ball out boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out boy
They figure Ye dress tight so we gonna dress tighter
He dress white so we gone dress whiter
So in spite of
Anything you mightve
Seen or heard
This scene occurred
Word
How can you say Kan is so pompous
You aint been to his concerts
You just talking that nonsense
He in the same league Nas is
Or Jay is
My favorite
A lot of people say thats where Ye is
Though a freshman still the West man
One of the best man like Taye Diggs
And I was oh so patient
While niggas straight disrespectin him
So I did what they aint expect from him
Dropped The Dropout and blazed em
And aint nobody feel my pain
Until the hits that I came with
Im Kanye not Kayne
But to you Im Rick James bitch
Uh And Ill be trying to come around my girl acting like Mr
Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get em a
Clone
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace
If yall fresh to death then Im deceased
And this one here is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like LW
Im calling
You my name is Kanye from the Rocafam
When the Glocks on jam so when we pop em scram
We showed you on champions how we get down
So dont twist your lips up like bobby brown
You got LL on your bedroom wall
Well Ill be double L trying to talk to yall
Now I aint even stay in class
To figure out RnB to get all of that

Im getting spins all day in LA
We can go to the D where Dwele dwell

Back in the Chi mean my life like a magazine
