Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Be in love again [Intro: Rihanna]

Really loves my company He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer I feel it in the air
As I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be
A murderer Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore
Uh
Anymore And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door

Now the pain is for pleasure
'Cause nothing can measure Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me 'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
But chains and whips excite me Na na na come on, come on, come on,

Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones,

S, S, S and M, M, M
S, S, S and M, M, M On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I left the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond So shine bright, tonight you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond [Narration]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed
That someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless; like nothing can save you
And when it's over, and it's gone
You almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good [Rihanna]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine (mine, mine, mine) We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't want to ever leave
Til the walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories This morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me how awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night
So I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each others backs, 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills,
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
With you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you, I'm out it Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go And you can see my heart, beating,
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart, beating,
Oh you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger) I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?"
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin' "How could I be so reckless?"
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want FourFiveSeconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday

How to make you feel like a man Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world Chest to chest, nose to nose
Palm to palm, we were always just that close
Wrist to wrist, toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king Eye to eye, cheek to cheek
Side by side, you were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn with the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us? In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king My California king
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart on me, my California king That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No) But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did (But I hate it) You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong (But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh) Sad, and it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond a reason why
And it just ain't right And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That's how much I love you (how much I need you)
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)
That's how much I need you (I need you) And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)
And I hate that I love you so (ooh) And I hate that I love you so, so Shine bright like a diamond

When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking

The sex doesn't get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I'mma roll
Even if I'm alone Sex with me, so amazing
All this all work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram with your temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
Sex with me so amazing, amazing, amazing hmmmm Sex with me
So amazing Everywhere is still
everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
suddenly I'm scared to be apart.
The days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe.
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep. Loving you is suicide
I Don't know should I go or should I stay?
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me.
That's the part I can't forget
and I wish that you'd come save me
cause' I'm standing over the edge. I should let you go
tell myself the things I need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong.
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
Feels like I drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between.
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
And it's killing every part of me. Loving you is suicide.
I don't know should I go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you loved me
that's the part I can't forget.
And I wish that you'd come save me boy
cause I'm standing over the edge. loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
And I... had as much as I can take
and love is a long way down. Loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
And I'm way past every moment
but I'm still determined to fight
and I know it's taking all my strength
to keep emotion alive.
Loving you is suicide Te amo, te amo, she say's to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra, she takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Te amo, te amo, she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uhh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water, I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you Yes we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I move under the light because I understand
That we all need love, and I'm not afraid
I feel the love but I don't feel that way Then she said Te amo, then she put her hand around my waist
I told her no, she cried Te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away, but let me go
My soul is awry and without asking why
I said Te amo, wish somebody would tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you
I think it means I love you, I love you Te amo, te amo, don't it mean I love you Yayo, yayo

Everybody right here,
What you need to do is be thankful
For the life you got, you know what I'm sayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
And start being thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way
I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
You know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience
But they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) just livin' my life I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate
But still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems
With their record sales just holler TIP
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow TIP
I got love for the game
But ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know
What you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches
'Cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy cars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows, just who ya are
So live your life (Hey! Ay ay ay)
You steady chasin' that paper, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
Ain't got no time for no haters, just live your life
(Hey! Ay ay ay)
No tellin' where it'll take ya, just live your life
(Oh! Ay ay ay)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser, just livin' my life
(Ay) my life (Oh) My life (Ay) my life (Oh)
Just livin' my life (Ay) my life (Oh)
My life (Ay) my life (Oh) Got everybody watchin' what I do
Come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (Shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life

So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and "I love you"
Is the only thing that's in my mind You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray
With a little bit too much to say Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now A drug and a dream
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that
I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again, to be in love again, to be in love again Be in love again I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time it didn't mean a thing My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart My mind is gone, I'm spinning round
And deep inside, my tears I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry How did I get here with you, I'll never know?
I never meant to let it get so, personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm, in this condition
And I've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)

Don't be the reason

And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on the brain, ball player in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (Won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (Gone)

Ey Rihanna:
I was picking up your clothes in the closet (closet)
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)
'Til I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha (Tasha)
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin (shockin)
It's on receipts here to tell you went shoppin (you dont say shopping teice)
You bought some Nike shoes
But why you buying stockings? Boy how could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go
I ain't standin around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat
Flat line on the EKG well, I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi
Saw your man in the club
i thought he was out of town doing business
said that he'd be back in three weeks?"
And now I'm mad
Sitting in the kitchen gettin sad
Looking at your pictures Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not acceptin another apology After 3 years, Ima let it go
cant standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
Ima leave your heart broken on the floor You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat
Flatline on the EKG Akon:
I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl (I did)
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listenin to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it (think about it)
Everything we do they gonna read about it (read about it)
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper
You know them haters
You hear that 808
The drum, that's my heart beat
I'm going numb, I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
I'm going under cardiac arrest Rihanna:
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
and so tempted to pull out your IV
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Trying to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heart beat
Flat line on the EKG Flat line on the EKG Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger
It seems like more than distance between us In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me
My California king
My California king In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
For you're heart on me

And some may in, wait this gone
But it's okay
Because it's so done
Fuck the shit up

Survivor, survivor I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love (stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love (you don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's not too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late) And I still don't know Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
I'm thinking in black and white
Thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I don't care I'm in love (stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person (but you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love (you don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late) Man, I know that it is hard to digest
But maybe this story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking you're the only option, oh (in a new direction)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking you're the only option (feel like a brand new person)
And I don't know how to describe (Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
(But you make the same old mistakes)
(You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option (But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (stop before it's too late)
Stop thinking you're the only option
Stop thinking you're the only option (Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night
(Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark

We gonna light up the night Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move, move, move
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move, move, move
Dancing in the dark Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night-time is the right time I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed
Move, move, move
Dancing in the dark I wanna dance in the dark and never stop
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars

Dancing in the dark Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be? It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby I'm falling down
I need me a remedy, been looking for remedies
I need you to be around, baby I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grand-mama's sofa
Girl I got us lovey dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your GUESS jeans on looking sexy, oh huh girl
Why could it not be the one? Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one? (Why? Why? Why?) All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got
All I've got are these photographs Chris Brown:
