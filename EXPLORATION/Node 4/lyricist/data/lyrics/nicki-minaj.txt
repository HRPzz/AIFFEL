And kiss the ground underneath

Go against Nicki, it's gon' cost ya
'Cause now it's fuck ya, intercourse ya
I rep Queens where they listen to a bunch of Nas

Lil Boogie down basic bitch thinkin' she back
Back to back, oh you mean, back to wack?

That's why Jay ain't clear his verse for your album
Sheneneh, you a fraud committin' perjury

I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire
In this very moment I'm king
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,
And I will retire with the crown, yes!

Clap for the heavyweight champ, me!

Everything that they deprived me of

Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be ya'll year we ain't get the memo
A young King, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is,
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives, ah! I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell its time
Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive. I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive, for life I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly Uh yo, yo,
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies uh huhuh huh yo a yo

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, bald like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing-sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up North when they ratted
Anyway I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in

Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her "make me some money", she tell me "make me a wife"
I tell that bitch "you crazy, fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hitting
And I say "what about them niggas?" She say: "what about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I'd get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'mma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her "stop lying, mine and who else?"
She say worry about yourself Lil Tune They holler at me, but it's you, you, this ain't high school

An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod

With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music,
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not) The wo-world is my punchin' bag and

You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Jee we did it, let's leave this imprint

Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me down
Oh, you're burnin' me down, burnin' me Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up
Light my body up [Chorus]
You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you You let me win,
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
And when they lookin'
You let me hide.
Defend my honor
Protect my pride.
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater.
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up.
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
Its like you got it
Down to a science
Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance.
You made me laugh
You make me horse
From yelling at you
And getting at you
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you.
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you. [Chorus: x2] What are we doing,
Could you see through me?
'Cause you say Nicki
And I say who me?
And you say no you
And I say screw you.
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But whats the reason.
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question,
Class is in session,
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul
OK your right
Just let it go.
OK you got it,
Its in the can.
Before I played it
You knew my hand.
You could turn a free throw into a goal.
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul. [Chorus: x2] Stop,
Stop,
Would you just stop looking through me
'Cause I just cant take it.
No I cant take it. You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you You see right through me.
(you see right through me baby)
You see right through me
You see right through me (Nicki Minaj)
I just had a epiphany,
I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers,
And my cookies always slippery
I don't need help,
I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin "fuck'em"
With a dildo sign
Five little mama, you a Three star
I aint sleepin when
I say I'm in my dream car
Oh did I stutta?
Harajuku hyphen,
Barbie... I'm hot
I think it's time to put the rice in
I was in the chair,
I was gluing my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin and leavin
Young money red flag,
No more auditions
Ask Lil Wayne who the 5 star bitch is! It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVD's made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's which World Tour should I go on and take
See you told me I would lose but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in L.A. with Lindsey
Got the eye of the tiger, the lion of Judah
Now it's me in my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gone see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal I hear they comin' for me

I'm the best I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sittin' at the closin' bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so
To all my bad bitches, I can see your halo I hear they comin' for me
Because the top is lonely

I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your B.M.W. every time you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believe you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that And yes I'm holdin you, holdin' you, holdin' you
Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter! When I slide down the ave I'm fuckin' trippin' (damn)
Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?
TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow
Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know
Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase
Cash in the air make her forget her date
Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway
If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate
How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down', rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em
Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow
Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel
Run back up and I turn into a bezel No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better

They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter! Hell no you can't use my lip gloss
Pop a perc' now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches, make a nigga dick soft
Bitch ball like I'm at tip off
Get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans I can slip off
Bitch I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for 5 years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me
Do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Though you knew better
Do your fucking research
You ain't know this the no rip zone
This the "You can't beat Nic" zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt's home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick, magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch I'm hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her (seer/CR)
Motherfuckers flexin', motherfuckers acting (actors, A.R)
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain't pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you're ugly it's a no text zone
It's a no sex zone, it's a no flex zone
Wack sauce I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you're ugly it's a no text zone

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter! Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (Splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters, God bless em' No flex zone, no flex zone

Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter! They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I could've went insane
And even now I think, "Do I really want this fame?"
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show [Chorus: x2]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up [Chorus] Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding baby Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours [Chorus] [Nicki Minaj:]
Oh I Get It Oh Okay, Niggas Tryna,

See I used to be the wife of a king,
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing.

Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding. [Chorus:]

In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians.

And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in,
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin') [Chorus:]

Young Money. [Chorus] If you could you would get rid of me,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold on now
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells b**** buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tech 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine. hit em wit a Tommy so my n****s call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin' the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my b****es did up, now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner, b****es like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, f*** I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffel. I'm a bad b**** no muzzle. (no muzzle).
B****es is softer than Al Dante, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja,
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks

This is for my n**** 7-up in Castaki
This is for my n****s wheeling them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish eggs
Kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda c***y.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
Oh [Chorus] If you could you would get rid of me,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)

They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"

Competition, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.

Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say s***
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say s*** put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say s*** but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them b****es just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a b****.
I still got that b**** cum on my lips
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You f***in' wit me if you f***in' wit Nick
They ain't f***in' wit me ,they ain't f***in' wit Nick
Your girlfriend and she just split
'cause she wanna f*** me and she wanna f*** Nick
They wonder if he be f***in' Nick, as long as she be f***in' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause, I swear y'all's a f***in' trip.
Young Money Dungeon, b****. my swagger is just punching b****
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of s***
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country b****. [Chorus] Wish you could get rid of Young Money,
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.

Rich friday Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs Are you alone?
Do you need someone? Is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?
Thousand words
Don't change a thing
Is it only three?
Three words that you're missing? Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved
(To love and to be loved) I'm losin' a thing
I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo I think I gave him a discrete name; he replied with a street name
P.R. at the heat game, no ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle; I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chilling, make a hell of a killing
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'm a don 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, enough said, pull off in that thing, and it's blush red Sex in the lounge, girl, I'm gon' take ya down
I'm gon' have you screaming, girl, they gonna hear the sound
Of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this has happened to me, girl
Happened to me, girl oh why So caught up in this girl
Shawty, got me hooked right now
Keeping true to myself, cause I'm so into her
Cause we doing it like nobody's around

My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I find
