[Spoken Intro:]
You ever want something 
that you know you shouldn't have 
The more you know you shouldn't have it, 
The more you want it 
And then one day you get it, 
It's so good too 
But it's just like my girl 
When she's around me 
I just feel so good, so good 
But right now I just feel cold, so cold 
Right down to my bones 
'Cause ooh... 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It's not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And she's always gone too long 
Anytime she goes away 

Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away 

I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, know, know, know, know, 
I know, I know, 
Hey I ought to leave 
I ought to leave her alone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness every day 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime she goes away


Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are

[Bridge:]
Please don't close the door to our future
There's so many things we haven't tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus:]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
I gotta be where you are


Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
Oh, girl please don't leave me

[Chorus:]
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl 

What can I say to make you stay 
Baby, don't leave me 
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you 

[Chorus:]
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love 

[Bridge:]
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it 

[Chorus:]
So tell me girl, it's not too late 
And you'll give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl 

Don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me 
Don't take your love from me 
Oooh, don't take your love from me 
Baby, don't take your love from me


[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way

Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need

[Refrain]
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today... 
In our small way


Got to be there, got to be there 
In the morning 
When she says hello to the world 
Got to be there, got to be there 
Bring her good times 
And show her that she's my girl 
Oh what a feeling there'll be 
The moment I know she loves me 
'Cause when I look in her eyes I realize 
I need her sharing her world beside me 

So I've got to be there 
Got to be there in the morning 
And welcome her into my world 
And show her that she is my girl 
When she says, "Hello world!" 
I need her sharing the world beside me 

That's why I've got to be there 
Got to be there where love begins 
And that's everywhere she goes 
I've got to be there so she knows 
That when she's with me, she's home 

Got to be there 
Got to be there


He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus:]
Rockin' robin, rock rock
Rockin' robin' 
Blow rockin' robin 
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 

Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee 
Every little bird in the tall oak tree 
The wise old owl, the big black crow 
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 

[Chorus]

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand 
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand 
They started going steady and bless my soul 
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol 

He rocks in the tree tops all day long 
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song 
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street 
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 

[Chorus]


When this old world gets you down 
When your spirit's on the ground 
Just remember I will always be around 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
When you're feeling all alone 
Like a child who's got no home 
You know you've always got a place where you can go 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Like a beach that knows no boundaries with all the trees 
As it rushes to the seas darling we'll be just as free 
I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

'Til you break those ties that bind 
'Til that day you're really mine 
Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

I'll lift your spirits high our love will fly 
We'll have heaven blue skies and forever sunshine 

We've got rainbows yet to find 
And we'll find them all in time 
Girl you know someday we'll even touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 

Anytime you want to leave your world behind 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love 
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky 
Just climb on the wings of my love 
Yes remember I will always be around 
I'll take you high on the wings of my love

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there

[Spoken:]
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away

[Spoken:]
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now

Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep

[Spoken:]
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air

Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone


When you're down and trubled 
And you need some love and care 
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right 
Just close your eyes and think of me 
And soon I'll be there to brighten up 
Yeah, even your darkest night 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 

[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yeah I will 
You've got a friend 

When the sky above you 
Grows dark and full of clouds 
And that old north wind 
He begins to blow 
Here's what you do baby 
Keep your head together 
And call my name out loud 
And soon you'll hear me 
Knockin' at your door 
Oh yes I will, yes I will 
You just call out my name 
And you know, wherever I am 
I'll come a-runnin' 
To see you again 

[Chorus]

Ain't it good to know 
That you've got a friend 
People can be so cold 
They'll hurt you and desert you 
And take your soul if you let them 
Oh, don't let them 

[Chorus:]
Winter, spring, summer or fall 
All you have to do is call 
And I'll be there, yes I will 

You've got a friend, yes you do 
You've got a friend, yes you do 
Right till the end, for you 
Ain't it good to know


Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
(You've got a friend in me) 

Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there) 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere) 
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go) 

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben 
(A friend) 
Like Ben
(Like Ben) 
Like Ben

With A Child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day

Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart

Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts

Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart

Sadness had been close as my next of kin

My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while

Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now) 

Where have I been? 
What lifetime was I in? 
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was 
Till now

Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oehoe happy

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go

And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all

They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love

And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all

Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers

E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another
Euphoria, euphoria
That's one word for heaven
Euphoria, euphoria
living your live as Heaven


Morning glow, morning glow
Starts to glimmer when you know
Winds of change are set to blow
And sweep this whole land through
Morning glow is long past due

Morning glow fill the earth
Come on shine far all you're worth
We'll be present at the birth
Of all faith looking new
Morning glow is long past due

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
You should have started long ago

Morning glow all days long
For we sing tomorrow's song
Never knew we could be so strong
But now it's very clear
Morning glow is almost here

Oh oh morning glow
I'd like to help you grow
We should have started long ago

Morning glow all of your life
We can make the new day right
All the bad songs of the night
Will fade into the past
Morning glow is here at last


We've been together for such a long time now
Music, music and me
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme
Now music, music and me

Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me

Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony

Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me


No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams

No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found

[Refrain]
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
(Cause we're almost there) 
Just one more step
(Just one more step) 
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
('Cause we're almost there) 

(Look at the lovers) 
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
(Life's long hard climb) 
They just couldn't take it
(They just couldn't take it) 

Don't let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darlin'
We'll make it through

Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
Keep on reachin, do it for me
Do it for me, cause baby

[Refrain]
('Cause we're almost there) 
(We're almost there) 
('Cause we're almost there) 

We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it 
(Can't afford to waste it) 

Need to feel your hand
Slippin' from mine? 
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Keep on tryin'

[Refrain]
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
(Cause we're almost there) 
Just one more step
(We're almost there) 
Don't give up
(Cause we're almost there) 
Just one more step

Baby baby, don't give up
('Cause we're almost there) 
Keep on, keep on
(We're almost there) 
Just one more step
('Cause we're almost there) 
Cause we're almost there

[Instrumental]

Juste one more step
Cause we're almost there
We've come to far
To turn around

Ooh!! 

Keep on reachin'
For higher ground
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Turn us around

Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there

Everything we're lookin' for
We're almost there
Keep on reachin' out for me

Cause we're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there

Ah we're almost there


Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I thought the grass was green on the other side
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye
There's a card in my hand
Tears fall like rain
I wanna come home again
I want you to... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ain't no love in this world
Ain't no love in this world without you

In my search to find myself
I saw your face and nothing else
Every place I go everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and... 

Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby
Ah take me back
Take me back where I belong
That's with you baby

I'm on my way back to you
And I wanna make it up to you
And all the prolems that I caused you
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me

Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive me


One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll . . . 

One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day . . . 

One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there


[VERSE 1]
Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one

All around me sunbeams
Start to fall

Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile

[VERSE 2]
Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna to fit

Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile

When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh

Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh

Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true

And forever is meant for so very few

We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time

Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you

And forever is meant for so very few

I Can't Help But See You
Running Often Through My Mind

[2nd Verse]
Helpless Like A Baby
Sensual Disguise
I Can't Help But Love You
It's Getting Better All The Time

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

You're An Angel In Disguise

[Chorus]
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To

I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No

[1st Verse]
You're Not Like Anybody I Ever Knew
But That Don't Mean That I Don't Know Where We Are
And Though I Find Myself Attracted To You
This Time I'm Trying Not To Go Too Far, Cause

[Bridge]
No Matter How It Starts It Ends The Same
Someone's Always Doing Someone More
Trading In The Passion For That Taste Of Pain
It's Only Gonna Happen Again

[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
All Night... All Night

[2nd Verse (Patti Austin)]
And Though I'm Trying Not To Look In Your Eyes
Each Time I Do They Kind Of Burn Right Through Me
Don't Want To Lay Down In A Bed Full Of Lies
And Yet My Heart Is Saying Come And Do Me

[Bridge (Michael)]
Now We're Just A Web Of Mystery
A Possibility Of More To Come
I'd Rather Leave The Fantasy Of What Might Be
But Here I Go Falling Again

[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry 
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High 
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry 
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High 
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry 
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High 
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry 
Over You... Over You (All Night)

[Chorus]
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
It's The Fallin' In Love That's Makin' Me High
It's The Being In Love That Makes Me Cry Cry Cry
All Night... All Night

[Fade-Out/Repeat]


[Verse 1:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Verse 2:]
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear the creature creepin'up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting to survive inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge:]
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life

[Verse 3:]
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All thru the night I'll save you from the terrors on the screen,
I'll make you see

[Chorus:]
That it's a thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

[Rap - Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
Can you dig it?!

[Into maniacal laugh, in deep echo]


They told him, "Don't you ever come around here.
Don't wanna see your face. You better disappear."
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it [4x]

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus 2x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it

Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

[Chorus 3x]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

Just beat it, beat it
Beat it, beat it, beat it


[1st verse]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

[2nd verse]
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

[3rd verse]
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice.)

[4th verse]
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby

[Bridge]
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine (Lighting the night)
Just put your trust in my heart and meet me in paradise (Now is the time)
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So let me keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love

Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinnin' by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you you're the lady in my life

Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or livin' in make believe (Don't you just see)
I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight that you will always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need you sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

Stay with me, I want you to stay with me
I need you by my side
Don't you go no where

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing

I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories.

I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.

Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me.

Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away


Don't let it get you down
When you're not on top

I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going know her way

There's sound of the melody
I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me
You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only
Oh, oh
(I see you love me) 

The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
But when you lend my mind
Have an answer now love don't hold me
All the girls have bringhten now
And the darkness is lighter now
Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye you today

Melodie, you're my symphony
All the song to me

You're my only

Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For you only


If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand

I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do

If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you) 

Would get embarrassed for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why

I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you

I only want to show you
That I'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...


Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah

It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries
Just won't do, ooh baby

Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?

Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe

Love you so much it's not funny

And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Oh, girl, you're so together

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you, 
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

I found my happiest days, 
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now

Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 

I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

Farewell, farewell
Farewell, farewell

And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget, no? 

I'll never forget you

When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
(Bye, bye) 

Don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, oohh, yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell


There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold

Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me

Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need

If you can't get enough
Call on me

I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me
Not to be with you 
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me 

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me

Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me... call on me


I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah

That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me

Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...


To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style

If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools

If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart

I've done all to be done 
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise, 
Shall follow the feel of constant care) 

In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God

For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile... 
(Proud)


Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, come on,
Lay it on me
All right...

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be...
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing

Gonna lock you up
Before too long,
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight,
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through...

Because I'm bad, I'm bad - come on

Fortune And Fame, A Life
That's So Carefree

But I Hate Sleepin' Alone
Why Don't You Come With
Me
I Said My Baby's At Home
She's Probably Worried
Tonight
I Didn't Call On The Phone To
Say That I'm Alright

Diana Walked Up To Me,
She Said I'm All Yours
Tonight
At That I Ran To The Phone
Sayin' Baby I'm Alright
I Said But Unlock The Door,
Because I Forgot The Key,
She Said He's Not Coming
Back
Because He's Sleeping With
Me

Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, Nah
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana, Nah

As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Just In Case

She's Got The Look
Wanting No Break Time
She's Got The Look
She's Driving Me Wild

She's Got The Look
Wanting No Break Time
She's Got The Look
She's Driving Me Wild

She's Got The Look ...


Do You Remember
When We Fell In Love
We Were Young
And Innocent Then
Do You Remember
How It All Began
It Just Seemed Like Heaven
So Why Did It End?

Do You Remember
Back In The Fall
We'd Be Together
All Day Long
Do You Remember
Us Holding Hands
In Each Other's Eyes
We'd Stare
(Tell Me)

Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You    Remember The Time
When We First Met
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Do You Remember
How We Used To Talk
(Ya Know)
We'd Stay On The Phone
At Night Till Dawn
Do You Remember
All The Things We Said Like
I Love You So
I'll Never Let You Go

Do You Remember
Back In The Spring
Every Morning Birds Would Sing
Do You Remember
Those Special Times
They'll Just Go On And On
In The Back Of My Mind

Do You    Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met Girl
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
Those Sweet Memories
Will Always Be Dear To Me
And Girl No Matter What Was Said
I Will Never Forget What We Had
Now Baby

Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time
When We First Met
Do You Remember The Time
When We Fell In Love
Do You Remember The Time

Do You Remember The Time

In The Park, On The Beach
Remember The Times
You And Me In Spain

I Thought She Had To Have It
Since The First Time She Came
Who Knows The Situation
Mysteries Do Remain
And Now I Wonder Why
I Breakdown When I Cry
Is It Something I Said
Or Is It Just A Lie
(Is It Just A Lie)

I Try So Hard To Love You
Some Things Take
Time And Shame
I Think The Whole World
Of You
Your Thoughts Of Me Remain
I'll Play The Fool For You
I'll Change The Rules For You
Just Say It And I'll Do
Just Make This Thing Come True
(Make A Dream Come True)

If I Let Her Get Away
Though I'm Begging
On My Knees
I'll Be Crying Everyday
Knowing The Girl
That Got Away

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

I Tried To Mastermind It
By Saying Let It Be
But Everytime I Did It
The Hurt Came Back At Me
I Told You That I Need You
A Thousand Times And Why
I Played The Fool For You
And Still You Said Goodbye
(Still You Said Goodbye)

If I Let Her Get Away
Then The World Will
Have To See
A Fool Who Lives Alone
And The Fool Who
Set You Free

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I've Got The Feelin'

Can't Let Go
Can't Let Go

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I Can't Let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
And it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough

I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean

[L. T. B. rap performance]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Michael]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now

[2x]
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white, woo


I Gave Her Money
I Gave Her Time
I Gave Her Everything
Inside One Heart Could Find
I Gave Her Passion
My Very Soul
I Gave Her Promises
And Secrets So Untold

And She Promised Me Forever
And A Day We'd Live As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Life Anew
And She Promised Me In Secret
That She'd Love Me For All Time
It's A Promise So Untrue
Tell Me What Will I Do?

And It Doesn't Seem To Matter
And It Doesn't Seem Right
'Cause The Will Has Brought
No Fortune

I Can't Take This Stuff No More

I Am The Damned
I Am The Dead
I Am The Agony Inside
The Dying Head
This Is Injustice
Woe Unto Thee
I Pray This Punishment
Would Have Mercy On Me

And She Promised Me Forever
That We'd Live Our Life As One
We Made Our Vows
We'd Live A Love So True
It Seems That She Has Left Me
For Such Reasons Unexplained
I Need To Find The Truth
But See What Will I Do!

I Can't Take It 'Cause I'm Lonely

You Are My Friend

Carry Me
Like You Are My Brother
Love Me Like A Mother
Will You Be There?

Weary
Tell Me Will You Hold Me
When Wrong, Will You Scold Me
When Lost Will You Find Me?

But They Told Me
A Man Should Be Faithful
And Walk When Not Able
And Fight Till The End
But I'm Only Human

Everyone's Taking Control Of Me
Seems That The World's
Got A Role For Me
I'm So Confused
Will You Show To Me
You'll Be There For Me
And Care Enough To Bear Me

Through Our Doubts
And Frustrations
In My Violence
In My Turbulence
Through My Fear
And My Confessions
In My Anguish And My Pain
Through My Joy And My Sorrow
In The Promise Of Another Tomorrow
I'll Never Let You Part
For You're Always In My Heart.

Like A Comet
Blazing 'Cross The Evening Sky 
Gone Too Soon

Like A Rainbow
Fading In The Twinkling Of An Eye
Gone Too Soon

Shiny And Sparkly
And Splendidly Bright
Here One Day
Gone One Night

Like The Loss Of Sunlight
On A Cloudy Afternoon
Gone Too Soon

Like A Castle
Built Upon A Sandy Beach
Gone Too Soon

Like A Perfect Flower
That Is Just Beyond Your Reach
Gone Too Soon

Born To Amuse, To Inspire, To Delight
Here One Day
Gone One Night

Like A Sunset
Dying With The Rising Of The Moon
Gone Too Soon

Gone Too Soon


The Way She Came Into The Place
I Knew Right Then And There
There Was Something Different
About This Girl

The Way She Moved
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Divinity In Motion

As She Stalked The Room 
I Could Feel The Aura
Of Her Presence
Every Head Turned 
Feeling Passion And Lust

The Girl Was Persuasive
The Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous

I Never Knew But I Was
Walking The Line
Come Go With Me
I Said I Have No Time
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
Talk On The Phone
My Baby Cried
She Left Me Standing Alone

She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me

She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her
Web Of Sin
A Touch, A Kiss
A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point 
Of No Return

Deep In The Darkness Of
Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous

I Never Knew
But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name
And Don't You Pretend 
You Never Did Me Before
With Tears In Her Eyes
My Baby Walked Out The Door

She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey 
But You're No Damn Good For Me 

Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
I Have To Pray To God
'Cause I Know How
Lust Can Blind
It's A Passion In My Soul
But You're No Damn Lover
Friend Of Mine

I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation
You Hurt My Baby

And Then It Happened
She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb
And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
Were As Sharp As 
A Two-Edged Sword
But I Loved It
'Cause It's Dangerous

Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me 

Dangerous 
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me 

Dangerous 
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me 

Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
I Have To Pray To God
'Cause I Know How 
Lust Can Blind
It's A Passion In My Soul
But You're No Damn Lover 
Friend Of Mine

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
they don't really care about
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us


I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

Like stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)
Like stranger in Moscow
(Lord have mercy)

[2x]
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like stranger in Moscow

[2x]
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow

"Why have you come from the West?
Confess! To steal the great achievements of the people, the accomplishments of the workers..."

[Rap: The Notorious BIG]
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
The fool comes slippin'
So I could blow'em open
This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks
Got Pitts by the door
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby

What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain...
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son...
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine...
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

[Verse 1:]
Money.
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the Holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You'll do anything for money...

[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 2:]
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cause your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones
With the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers... Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You'll do anything for money...

[Chorus:]
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil (I)
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I
Even sell my soul to the devil

[Verse 3:]
You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God
Then you will hell him
You'll do anything for money

Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything now
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil


[Written by John Lennon]

Here come ol' flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got Joo Joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker he just do what he please

He wear no shoe shine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free

Come together
Right now
Over me

He bag production
He's got walrus gum-boot
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal cracker
He got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arm 'til
You can feel his disease

Come together
Right now
Over me
Come together babe
Come together babe
Come together
Come together

He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one Mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see

Come together
Right now
Over me


Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay

you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone...
Not alone ohh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, Not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone


Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me...

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood
I've never known...

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne...

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood I've never known...

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood...


Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory

It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory

It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it

Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable


Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands

You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realizm

Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla
Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Who are you

Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it

He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...

Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world


Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...

A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care,
Oh the blood in her hair...

Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...

But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...

It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...

She knew no one cared...

Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair


Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile 
If you just...

Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...

Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by...

If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile...

That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile


She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane

Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right

She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill

She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past

Every night stance is like takin a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it

Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife 
Susie's got your number 
Susie says its right

It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)

And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Ooo...

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aaow

There's a tappin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

Don't understand it
Hey!
Don't understand it
Hey.

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a tappin in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

Don't understand it!
Yeah Yeah!
Don't understand it!
Your just a dog gone!
Aaow!

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back,
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aaow!

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aaow
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy


There's a ghost out in the hall 
Theirs a goul beneath the bed 
Now it's coming through the walls 
Now it's coming down the stairs 

Then there's screaming in the dark 
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air 
Ghosts be hiding everywhere 

I'm gonna be 
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose haunting me 
Your warning me 
To be the stranger 
In your life 

Am I amusing you 
Or just confusing you 
Am I the beast 
You visualised 
And if you wanna to see 
Eccentrialities 
I'll be grotesque 
Before your eyes 

Let them all materialise

Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh
Is it scary for you baby 
Is it scary for you 

You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby 

There's a creak beneath the floor 
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there 
Their's a ghostly smell around 
But nobody to be found 
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke 

I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see 
So did you come to me 
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes 

A haunting ghostly treat 
The foolish trickery 
And spirits dancing 
In the light 

But if you came to see 
The truth the purity 
It's here inside 
A lonely heart 

So let the performance start 

Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh 
Am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you 
So tell me is it scary for you baby
So tell me is it crazy for you baby 
Am I scary for you 

You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for ya

Masquerade the heart 
Is the height of haunting souls 
Just not what you seek of me 
Can the heart reveal the proof 
Like a mirror reveals the truth 
See the evil one is you

Is that scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you oh
Am I scary for you baby
Is it scary for you 
So tell me am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for ya baby 
Is is scary for ya baby 
Am I scary for you 
(I don't wanna talk about it)

Am I scary for you baby 
Am I scary for you 
I'm tired of being abused 
You know you're scaring me too 
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby


Now I'm just wondering why you think 
that you can get to me with anything 
seems like you'd know by now 
When and how I get down 
And with all that I've been through, 
I'm still around 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
Baby I've got what it takes 
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it 
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable 
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it 
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 

Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
that if you block me, you've done your thing 
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
I´m steady laughin', while surfacing 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
baby I've got what it takes 
and there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS 2x]

You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing 
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
Through all your lies and silly games 
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable 

[RAP]

[CHORUS 3x]


Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs 
she only knows how low that she can go 
She speaks the lines that can control my mind 
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow 
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant 
only for me, then spoke with her body 
her only goal is just to take control 
And I can't believe that I can´t tell her no 

[CHORUS]
That girl I can't take her 
should have known she was a heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker 
That girl I can't take her 
should have seen it coming heartbreaker 
that girl I can't take her 
should have seen right thriough her 
she's a heartbreaker 

She plays a game with such an innocent face 
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case 
Her actions confess and put me through the test 
I was surprised that I was caught inside 
Now she's thinking that I will never know 
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go 
But I hope in time that she will finally realize 
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same 

[CHORUS 2x]

I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you 
Stop being without you 
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you 
and start being without you 
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you 
and stop talkin' aboout you 
and what will she say? 
She will say I was the man that got away 

[RAP ]

[CHORUS OUT]


If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

[Chorus:]
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

[Chorus]

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby

[RAP]

[Chorus x3]


Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, makin’ love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking though the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go

Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn

[Chorus]
I don’t want the sun to shine I wanna make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m gonna do I can’t stop lovin’ you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn makin’ love

Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never know

Break of dawn, there’s no sun up in the sky
Break of dawn, I can see it in your eyes
Break of dawn, girl you got to understand
It’s the way that I love you, let me show you I’m your man
Break of dawn

[Chorus x 2]

Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin’ love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh

[Chorus x 3]


[CHORUS]
Tell the angels no, I don’t wanna leave my baby alone
I don’t want nobody else to hold you
That’s a chance I’ll take
Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay
Heaven can wait

You’re beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible
And I don’t know what I’d do, if I can’t be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn’t wanna go if I can’t see your face, can’t hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no

[CHORUS]

Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you’d be moving on
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I’d tell them no

[CHORUS]

Oh no, can’t be without my baby
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can’t be without my baby
Won’t go, without her I’d go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh

[CHORUS]

Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone


Ho...oh...

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk

I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my
life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See, I
finally found, come on, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently

Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all
my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find

Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)

you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)

And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world (Oh...), you know you did
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

Girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to
me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did,

And everything I own I give ('Cause you rocked my
world)

Someone like you to call mine


All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when 
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

[Chorus]
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I


Your love is magical, that's how I feel 
But I have not the words here to explain 
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion 
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain 
To tell you how I feel 
But I am speechless, speechless 
That's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say 
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray 
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside 
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side 
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found 
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground 
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real 
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face 
There's no mountain high I cannot climb 
I'm humbled in your grace 
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real 
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel 
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real 
SpeechlessYour love is magical, that's how I feel 
But in your presence I am lost for words 
Words like, "I love you."


Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I’m real
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal

[CHORUS]
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload
2000 Watts, 8 ohms, 200 volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don’t overload

3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when  I reach I can go ‘til I hit my peak
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me

[CHORUS]

[AD LIBS]

[CHORUS OUT]


Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus:]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life

Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

[Chorus]

You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope is lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me


Don’t walk away
See I just can’t find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray

[CHORUS 1]
And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it’s been so long now all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away
‘Cause the pain gets stronger every day

[CHORUS 2]
How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away

See now why
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
Everything we said and all we done now
Don’t let go, I don’t wanna walk away
Now why
All my dreams been broken
Don’t know where we’re going
Everything begins to set us free
Can’t you see, I don’t wanna walk away

If you go, I won’t forget you girl
Can’t you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There’ nothing left to do
Don’t walk away


Ain’t the pictures enough, why do you go through so much
To get the story you need, so you can bury me
You’ve got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am

You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
won’t you just let me be
‘cause you cameras can’t control, the minds of those who know
That you’ll even sell your soul just to get a story sold

[CHORUS]
I need my privacy, I need my privacy
So paparazzi, get away from me

Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven’t heard
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away

Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why
No there’s a lesson to learn, respect’s not given, it’s earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

[CHORUS]

Now there’s a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

[CHORUS x 3]


[Verse 1]
Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end

[Verse 2]
Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

[Chorus:]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Verse 3]
People laugh when they're feelin sad
Someone is taking a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
when your children cried last night?

[Verse 4]
Faces fill with madness
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is reach for the truth

[Chorus]

And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers

[Chorus x3]

Change the world


We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing

[CHORUS 1]
So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I’m keeping a place

[CHORUS 2]
For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home

Home with their fathers,
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee

[CHORUS 3]
So pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home


He gives another smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand

Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he say
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tried to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

See, don't you do it baby
I said yeah
Don't you let go baby
See, you
Don't you do it

Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

Don't you let go baby
Don't you, don't you let go
I said yeah
Can I get how it feels baby
Don't you let go baby
Yeah
Oh
Whatever happens, just don't let go of, my hand.

[Carlos Santana:] Thank you, man!
[Michael Jackson:] Thank you, Carlos!


[ROD SERLING INTRO]
Tonight’s story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn’t I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.

You’re fearing me, ‘cause you know I’m a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed
I’m underneath
You’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream it’s ‘cause of me
I’m the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me

[CHORUS]
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks of me, threatened
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

You think you’re by yourself, but it’s my touch you felt
I’m not a ghost from Hell, but I’ve got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere
In one blink I’ll disappear, and then I’ll come back to haunt you
I’m telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I’m the one watching you
That’s why you got to be threatened by me

[CHORUS]

[ROD SERLING VERSE]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that’s the case
Never Neverland, that’s the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.

[CHORUS x 3]

[ROD SERLING OUTRO]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn’t. It’s the beginning.

I don't care a jack, or about what cha' do, 
Just put ya dime on the line baby, cos i own you, 

[CHORUS]
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need

Ya smilin at me while, ya stealin right before my eyes 

[CHORUS]
Somebody said, give up instead on how ya feel, 
One blow to the head is all ya need,

[BRIDGE]
I hurt my backbone baby,
I start to give it up,
Life is an aggrovator,
Sometimes I part it up,
I broke my radiator,
I'm indestructible,
I pray to leave my body,
Don't you ever call!

[VERSE 3]
I don't care a jack, or about what you do 
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you 
Cheater...

[CHORUS]
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need,
Cheater... 
Cheater...


Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone

Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

[Chorus:]
I wanna spend, time to live in
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

[Chorus]

You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams

[Chorus 2x]

(All of the time, here in my heart)


You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier 
And you still deal with the fires 
That they made...

Why you wanna fix me?

Why you stab me in the back?


Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me babe
Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me babe
Tell me what's goin' down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
I don't even wanna say it
Cause of all the blasphemy
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business goin' down

Well lord have mercy
Well lord have mercy
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
Don't be callin' down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even burst the breast
Don't be callin' out "Mercy me"
Don't be goin' down babe

Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doin' it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down

I read the paper
And I can't believe what's goin' round
Somebody's doin' it to
Somebody's up, somebody's down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shy with me

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
You're dirty
You're dirty
Dirty, dirty baby

Your brother's gone and kissed
The mother-in-law
I might tell Dad about what I saw
Your brother didn't make a nickel
Or dime too
Sittin' round tellin' how he did it to you

Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business goin' down
Goin' down babe
Monkey business goin' down
I'm not satisfied baby
Monkey business goin' down
You wanna party
Monkey business goin' down
My business, is your business
Monkey business goin' down
I caught your mother she doin' a dude
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Monkey business goin' down
Monkey see, monkey do
You can't like it that I'm looking right at you
Your business, is my business
Monkey business goin' down
Your business, is my business
Monkey business goin' down


Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the 
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon

Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon


All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

When someone in the dark reaches out for you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!


All alone she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doing wrong
On the move got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the news

You're living on sunset time
(Uuh)

Feeling bad
You're living much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breaking every law

[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

On the go
Got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Living hot, doing what you should not
The break is on me then what do you got
We're living on sunset time

(Want that dime)

Shoot the breeze
You feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you wanna be
Who's to trust when living dangerous
Tonight is your night but this is what you loose

[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Getting higher
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

(uuh)
(pah dah dah dah)

You are there when the night's in town
Standing there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema
You think there's nothing wrong

Going town
You do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon
Gotta fever in your shoes
The night's on you
What are you gonna do?

[CHORUS]
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver
You're a Saturday nighter (aaw)

(pah dah dah dah dah)
(hee hee hee)
(aah) (pah dah dah)
(uuh)
(hee)
(uuh)
(hee)
(uuh)

Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dimelight
From one more violent crime

She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun

In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He's awaken, ground is shakin
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain

He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?

Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice

Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby

We can't take it
We've already had enough

Deep in my soul baby

Deep in your soul and let God decide

Deep in my soul

It's up to me and I'm still alive

They've gotta hear it from us

We can't take it
We've already had enough

It's going down baby
Just let God decide,

It's going on baby
Just let God decide

Deep in my soul baby

We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us

We can't, we can't
We've already had enough


Uh, oh,...

Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tanned
in her painted on jeans

She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again

West bound Greyhound
To tinsel town
Just to pursue her movie star dreams
She's giving hot tricks to men
just to get in
When she was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)

[Spoken words:]
She gave up her life, to follow her dreams
Left behind everything, for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood

Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tanned
in her painted on jeans

She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you, may never ever have that chance again (that chance again)


She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
She works in a restaurant night and day,
She waits her life away,
She wipes her tears away.
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries

No...

[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
I can't even breathe (just lean on me),
I can't even see!
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today!
All you need is love,
I tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
Keep your head up!

[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my...

Everybody say that time is borrowed,
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance,
Fight the circumstance,
Rise and do it again

[Chorus:]
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

[in background:]
I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now

Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!

I was alone in the dark when I met ya
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)

You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh

[Chorus:]
I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you're holdin' me

It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me
You'll seeeee...

...it won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet ya
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh
I thank the Heavens above that I met ya
Uuuuuuuuuuh uuuuuuh

I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
Uuuuuuuuuuh

[Chorus 2:]
I like the way how you're lovin' me
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me
I like the way how you're holdin' me
It doesn't matter how you re lovin' me
I like the way how you're touchin' me
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me
I like the way how you're kissin' me
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me

[Verse 3:]
The world's a better place
'cause you came in time,
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine,
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time,
Uuuuuuuuuuh Ahhhhhhhh.

[Chorus:]
I like the way how you're holdin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are holdin' me,
I like the way how you're lovin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are lovin' me,
I like the way how you're touchin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are touchin' me,
I like the way how you're kissin' me,
It doesn't matter how you are kissin' me,
You'll seeeee.

I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moon light, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around (the only one around)
When things will hurt you
I am forever.

Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

I am a friend through thick and thin
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever

I am the one who said that you are free
When it seems so hard to be the only one
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the words keep turning down
When things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

You are the sun in the Southern sky, when things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
We are forever, … keep on, we are forever, … keep on, have to be strong
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am forever.


Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson
Reporters stalking the moves of Michael Jackson
Just when you thought he was done
He comes to give it again
They could print it around the world today
He wanna write my obituary

No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

[Chorus:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?
How am I crazy cause I just don’t know
This is breaking news
This is breaking news

Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson
You write the words to destroy like it’s a weapon
You turned your back on a love and you can’t get it again.

No matter what, you just want to read it again
No matter what, you just want to feel it again

[Chorus x2:]
Why is it strange that I would fall in love?
Who is that boogieman you’re thinking of?

My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love

I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)

At night pray before I sleep in hope of finding you
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love

[x2]
I walked away but I was wrong (I can't make it another day)
You're the one that makes me strong (I can't fake it another day)
You're the fire that keeps me warm (I can't make it another day)
How will I get through this storm? (I can't make another day without your love)


All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
it cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
and you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Cos when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me

Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
If you can't answer
You know me

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry girl (Cry girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)

I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you
Your sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

Who do you love?
Is it me? 
With You? 
I don't know 
Who do you love, babe? 
I don't want ya 
If you can't answer 
I know you 

(Heaven must be wary) 
Heaven must be wary 
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every Year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be wary) 
Heaven must be wary 
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)

I Walk around i'm suffering in my doom 
And when I come to you 
Your sitting in your room 
You sit around in the strangest place 
So take off the mask 
So I can see your face

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much to soon

I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
Day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Oh, oh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon


Are you ready for a real good time
Are you ready for a real good treat
There'll be so much dancing, singing
I let you fall into me

[Chorus:]
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey

If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
I’ll be so proud if you let me love ya girl
Let me love ya for a little while

[Chorus:]
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey
Oho yeah yeah,
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah

Now she started finger popping to the beat
So I said lets get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No no don't mess around with me
I ain't playing

[Chorus:]
Don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey hey
So don’t be messin’ around, don’t be messin’ around
Don’t be messin’ around hey hey

[Chorus x2]


There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And after be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And after we all did?

She told me she forgiving me
A lifetime Love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing to keep from feelin’ blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

Here I am so all alone
And I am so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t explain, I’m all alone
You used to love me
I feel I’m your blue

They told me you should sing a song
Of happy with your feelin’ blue
I’m singing for so very long
Still crying, tell me what should I do.

All I know is
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa [x2]
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

She told me she forgiving me
A life time, love so guarantee (guarantee)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singing crying helplessly
But I’m keep singing

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no)
Tschada dada dada daa
Come on take me please

(Set me free)

(Wooh)

Tschada dada dada daa (Oh no) (And I keep crying)

Tschada dada dada daa (Hold on, Hold on)
Come on take me please

Sister don’t read, she’ll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian soul
What do we get, she runs away
What about love?
What about all I pray

Don’t know the worst, she knows a atheist
What about God?
Living is all I see
What do you get, things she would say
What about love?
That’s all I pray

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I’d like to have my child

Sister confused, she went alone
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding a life, reading the words
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse

Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the lie, you keep it low
What about heart?
That’s all I’ve known

Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak

What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
Feel my sin

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, I’d like to have my child

Those abortion papers (Hoo!)
Think about life, I’d like to have my child

Who have the grateful?
Where will she go?
What will she do to see the world?

Sister don’t know, where would she go
What about life?
What about all I saw?
What would you do?
Don’t get so confused
Love all the things
It’s just the things I do

[Laughing]

"Ronny, you're so silly."


I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way that things could have been
She said that I don't care
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy had turned to pain

Father always told me,
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't you feel no pain? (No way!)

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' no pain!
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame
So don't you ever complain!

I am the cover of the magazine, what a scene
They know my every do's
“Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine.”
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind
Someone is following you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move!

My father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reaching for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain!

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain!
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' no pain!

It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame! (uh)
Father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling this way boy!

I'd like to take sometime and get away, then they'll say,
Is that boy still alive? (uh)
The week in village...what a thrill
Only the strong survive

My father always told me,
You won't live a quiet life,
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy (oh?)
Then stand here in my shoes
And then think of my blues!

It’s the price of fame!
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't be feeling this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don't be feeling no pain boy!


Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied down his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get her?

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And it told her out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Oh!

Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone said it
So sad, regret it
And a man is out tonight

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

You should have told her (should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her about us (oh, ba-da)
No one's sleeping(no-one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (oh-oh)

You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her about us
No one's sleeping
Nobody should be grievin' this way

Oh!

Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Scream in my face then pushed you back
She should have spied under his skin
Now it's my job to get revenge

Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?


Como la brisa
Tu voz me acaricia
Y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece

Tu amor aparece
Y me hace feliz
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien

Que nadie te querra
Como yo
Tu me haces sentir
Deseos de vivir,
Junto a ti por siempre

Tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama
Tu eres quien gana
En mi corazon
Porque me has dado

Algo sagrado
Con tu pasion
Me conoces bien
Y sabas tambien

Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estas
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida

Si tu te vas
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas

No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
Noche de estrellas

Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera

Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo se
Pero siento que
Te quiero y sola
Viva por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien

Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tu
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tu

Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de
Lo que das tu
Pues todo mi amor eres tu

Cambiaremos al mundo manana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti

Todo mi amor eres tu
(now baby, oh)
Todo mi amor eres tu
(if I ain't stop!)

Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu ...


Je ferme les yeux
Je me sens fiévreux
Sans toi j'ai froid
J'aimerais t'appeler
J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi
Ce que je ressens
Personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Pour la première fois
Je sais que c'est toi
J'ai besoin de rêver
Je vais t'emmener

L'été finira
Près du feu de bois
On fera l'amour
Blottie contre toi
Je te dirai tout bas
Tu me rends folle
Ce que je ressens personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien près de toi
J'en perd ma fierté
Je ne veux plus tricher
La vérité pour moi
C'est la vie avec toi

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

Et danser tout l'hiver
Sans toi c'est un enfer
Ne t'en vas pas
Et pouvoir t'embrasser
J'en tremble rien d'y penser
Tout te donner
Les femmes d'avant toi
Ne comptent même pas
J'ai oublié tout ton passé
Le terre pous trembler
La guerre éclater
Je supporterai tout
Écoute-moi mon amour

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous

Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous


[Pitbull:]
Love it or hate it, it's Mr. Worldwide
With the world greatest
You gonna play this
Well, like a woman that's pregnant for ten months
Be the latest
Don't delay this
I'm on that
Roll it
Making a toast to the king
MJ for life
I mess with good women
But you know that they bad
That's right

[Michael Jackson:]
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Shameone
Shameone
Lay it on me
All right

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again, 
Who's bad

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
Shameone
Shameone, lay on me
The world is out
You're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long,
Your lyin' eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwin' stones
To hide your hands

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't slap my face
Because I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone, you know
(Bad bad - really, really bad)
Woo! Woo! Woo!
(And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again...)
Who's bad

[Pitbull:]
Making a toast to the king
We're bad for life

[Michael Jackson:]
Shameone
Shameone
Lay it on me

[Pitbull:]
P-I-T is B-A-D
Michael Jackson, R.I.P.
Catch a chicken with a P-Y-T
All off in Paris
Ooh, oui, oui
I've been around the world getting off the chain
And ain't nothing changed
Luchando
Except not a sun and a moon know me by my first name, Armando
De santo no tengo nada
Y de diablo lo tengo todo, ay de todo
Mamita, te tengo la came
Hazme el favor y prestame el mojo
I'm so at it
I speak a third language
Called that moon talk
In four years catch me with a billon
Doing that moonwalk

[Michael Jackson:]
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - shameone
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know it - you know it - you know
You know - you know - shameone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you
You know I'm smooth - I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - I'm bad baby
You know, you know, you know it - shameone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Woo!
Who's bad
Who's bad
You know I'm bad, I'm bad - you know it
You know I'm bad - you know
Woo!
You know I'm bad - you know it
You know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad


Hoo!

Aaow!

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
And nothing gonna stop
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

Because

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stoppin' at nothin'
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

Aaow!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)

(Speed demon)

Go!
Aaow!

Hoo!

Just pull over boy and get your ticket right

I'm heading for the border
It's on my mind
And nothing really matter
I've got to be on time
