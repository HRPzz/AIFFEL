Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet
Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy
You went back to what you knew
So far removed from all that we went through
And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I'll go back to black We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
I go back to us I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow, and I love puff
And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
Black
I go back to
I go back to We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black You should be stronger than me
You've been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am
You always want to talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control
All I need is for my man to live up to his role
You always want to talk it through, I'm okay
I always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy He said "the respect I made you earn
Thought you had so many lessons to learn"
I said "You don't know what love is get a grip
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just want to grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go I'd rather be at home with a Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway I didn't get a lot in class
But I know we don't come in a shot glass They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, "no, no, no"
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go The man said, "why do you think you here?
I said, I got no idea.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, I just think you're depressed
This, me, yeah, baby, and the rest They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know I don't ever want to drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend And it's not just my pride
It's just till these tears have dried They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, no, no, no
Yes, I been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Why don't come over Valerie? Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good All I can ever be to you is a darkness that we knew
And this regret I got accustomed to
Once it was so right
When we were at our height
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match
But every moment we could snatch
I don't know why I got so attached
It's my responsibility
You don't owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I don't understand
Why do I stress the man
When there's so many bigger things at hand?
We could've never had it all
We had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you
And perspective pushes through
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
I cannot play my self again
I should just be my own best friend
Not fuck my self in the head with stupid men He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own I wish I could sing no regrets
And no emotional debt
'Cause as we kissed goodbye, the sun sets
So we are history
Your shadow covers me
The sky above ablaze
That only lovers see He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My blue shade
My tears dry on their own Whoa, he walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry on their own He walks away
The sun goes down
He takes the day, but I'm grown
And in your way
My deep shade
My tears dry For you I was the flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is losing game One I wished, I never played
Oh, what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand Self-professed profound
Till the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand Though I battled blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game It's okay in the day
I'm staying busy
Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he
Got so sick of crying
So just lately
When I catch myself, I do a one-eighty
I stay up, clean the house
At least I'm not drinking
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking
That silent sense of content
That everyone gets
Just disappears 'soon as the sun sets He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone If I was my heart
I'd rather be restless
The second I stop, the sleep catches up
And I'm breathless
'Cause this ache in my chest
As my day is done now
The dark covers me, and I cannot run now
My blood running cold
I stand before him (before him, I)
It's all I can do to assure him (assure him)
When he comes to me
I drip for him tonight
Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts
He floats me with dread
Soaked in soul
He swims in my eyes by the bed
Pour myself over him
Moon spilling in
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone
And I wake up alone Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby you are the soul, snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time your near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so
Very close to you, turns me into your slave
Come on and do with me any little thing that you want to
Anything, baby just let me get next to you So am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue sky, how I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again baby won't you
Come and put our two hearts together
That would make me strong and brave
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Now if there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let in rain
I'm sure our love together would endure a hurricane
Oh my baby won't you please let me love you
And get a release from this awful misery What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Don't you understand me, now baby please
Pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take
I'll be what you make me, my darling Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a lovin' state of mind
I'm so tired of being without it
And never known what love's about
James Moody would you come on hit me,
You can blow now if you want to, I'm through Nobody stands in between me and my man
It's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (oh, Slick Rick)
And thought I didn't love you when I did (when I did)
Can't believe you played me out like that (ah) No, you ain't worth guest list
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (all them girls)
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (to yourself)
Can't believe you played yourself (out) like this Ruler's one thing, but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones (me and Mr. Jones) What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (dick to me)
I might let you make it up to me (make it up)
Who's playing Saturday? What kind of fuckery are you?
'Side from Sammy, you're my best black Jew
But I could swear that we were through (we were through)
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do Mr. Destiny, nine and fourteen
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr. Jones
Yeah (me and Mr. Jones) (me and Mr. Jones) There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
"Seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret I'd like
To add his initial
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb? There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? It's never safe for us
Not even in the evening
'Cause I've been drinking
Not in the morning
When your shit works
It's always dangerous
When everybody's sleeping
And I've been thinking
Can we be alone?
Can we be alone? When will we get
The time to be
Just friends?
When will we get
The time to be
Just friends? And, no, I'm not ashamed
But the guilt will kill you
If she don't first
I'll never love you like her
Thought we need to find a time
To just do this shit together
'Fore it gets worse
I want to touch you
But that just hurts When will we get
The time to be
Just, just friends?
When will we get
The time to be

The lips that I am missing
And hope that your dreams will come true And then while I'm away

All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, all my loving, I will send to you Her name is Cherry, we've just met
But already she knows me better than you
She understands me after eighteen years
And you still don't see me like you ought to do Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
While I love her every sound
I dunno how to turn you down And you're so thick and my patience thin
So I got me a new best friend
With a pickup that puts you to shame
And Cherry is her name And when I'm lonely, Cherry's there
And she plays along while I sing out my blues
I could be crying and you don't care
You won't call me back, you're stubborn as a mule Maybe we could talk 'bout things
If you was made of wood and strings
You might think I've gone too far
I'm talking 'bout my new guitar Wish I could say it breaks my heart
Like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
A nightingale no longer singing Its something I know you can't do
Separate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
Your still clinging to that notion Every thing is slowing down
River of no return
Recognize my every sound
There is nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night, in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mines a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my bed I never thought my memory
Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did Now its not hard to understand
Why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
River of no return
You recognize my every sound
There's nothing new to learn You'll never get my mind right
Like two ships passing in the night
In the night in the night
Want the same thing where we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way
A different way from where I'm going
Oh, its you again listen this isn't a reunion
So sorry if I turn my head
Yours is a familiar face
But that don't make your place safe
In my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed When you walk in the bar
And you dressed like a star
Rockin' your f me pumps
And the men notice you
With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to 'Cause you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's you whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
'Cause your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
You don't like ballers
They don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You're more than a fan
Lookin' for a man
But you end up with one-night-stands
He could be your whole life
If you got past one night
But that part never goes right In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no taste
Don't be too upset
If they call you a skank
'Cause like the news everyday you get pressed You don't like players
That's what you say-a
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire
Or them big baller
Don't do nothing for ya
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller You can't sit down right
'Cause you jeans are too tight
And your lucky its ladies night
With your big empty purse
Every week it gets worse
At least your breasts cost more than hers So you did Miami
'Cause you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting cane Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife
All those men just go home to their wives Don't be mad at me
'Cause you're pushing thirty
And your old tricks no longer work
You should have known from the jump
That you always get dumped
So dust off your fuck me pumps Brother
There's so much that I could never say to your face
Bye, bye now
You should know the world and all its ways so find your place How do I find words that do not condescend
When she bore you before me
'Cause she doesn't need a child, she needs a friend
A son not a sob story (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were She can't always be there just to hold you down
Our mother
When you are at a age now well life turns around
My brother Realize that you don't have to answer to no man
Responsibility comes down to you
But how can I expect you to understand
When you live life like its so run through (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
Your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were (Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
And your priority, it must be heard
(Now you must have never heard of what she did for you)
'Cause we'll never be the way we were The way we were, we'll never be
And your priority, it must be heard Build your dreams to the stars above
But when you need someone to love
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Play with fire till your fingers burn
And when there's no place for you to turn
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me For, when you hear a call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart I know
I've been through it all, for I'm an old hand
And I'll understand if you go So
Make your mark for your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers, darling, come to me Whoa, oh
Oh, whoa, oh He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on, but no one's home
She's so vacant
Her soul is taken
He thinks, What's she running from? Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies Even if she's content in his warmth
She is plagued with urgency
Searching kisses
The man she misses
The man that he longs to be Now, how can he have her heart
When it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her
'Cause what's inside her it never dies So he tries to pacify her
But what's inside her never dies Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh huh And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this, no no, I observe yeah, I don't chase
But now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face, yeah
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be Although my pride, yeah, is not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans, yeah and your Beasties tee, yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this, no with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah
Oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such
But I never hated myself, for my age so much, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb, yeah
So with your battered jeans, yeah, and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me, yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easy to disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beasties tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me To know know know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see that smile
Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him To know know know him

Makes my life worthwhile To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do

And I do I don't catch your drift and I don't catch your plan
Need to get my thoughts down but it's getting late
Need to get up now, get my feet on the ground
But the show is so unprepared now My place so messed up, I tried on some shoes
Should think clear and focus but I've things to do
Glancing at my CD rack, eyes linger on Frank
And I must put that check in the bank Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I will finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Always got something to do, someone to be seeing
Somewhere to be dancing, I'm a wake human being
It's an opportunity, shout till you go blue
Unless I wanna do it, your words go through Need to buy some cigarettes, can't put it off any longer
Worked appeal depression, I feel it growing stronger
Maybe when I'm all grown up, I will get it through
But right now I got stuff to do Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Gotta get this song down before I leave tonight
But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now
I have to get this down before I leave somehow And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing Try to put me in a room, distraction less
(Everything is everything)
Spare me from worse
In the studio, I would finally burn
(All the time is all you got)
Tempted to work Put me in a room, distraction less
Spare me from worse
In the studio I would finally burn
Tempted to work Distraction less
Spare me from worse
I would finally burn
Tempted to work When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there Darling they empathize
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You've got the degree in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
('Cause you so smart)
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)
'Cause it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
(What do you want) To hold your head above the sea
(Keep you high and dry)
And carry you even though you're bigger
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure And anyway we're still so young
(Yeah I'm so young)
And this isn't yet the day I can't help you if you won't help yourself
No I can't help you if you don't help yourself
(You won't help yourself)
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help you if you won't help yourself You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years oh most of the time
And I'm, I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
You are like nothing that I ever knew I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my love in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you I know your image of me is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Darlin' can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for in my life you are a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song for you
We were alone and I was singing this song for you Understand once he was a family man
So surely I would never, ever go through it first hand
Emulate all the shit my mother hated
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate
My alibi for taking your guy
History repeats itself, it fails to die
And animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?
My destructive side has grown a mile wide
And I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
Tell you baby, you huggin' up the big monkey man I never saw you, I only heard of you

Huggin' up the big monkey man
La la la la la la la
Huggin' up the big monkey man There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No sweeter song, no heart so true There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that you are mine alone There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
I would be behind him
Straight shook up beside him
With strength he didn't know
It's you I'm fighting for
He can't lose with me in tow
I refuse to let him go
At his side, and drunk on pride
We wait for the blow Put it in writing
But who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor
Justice done
Reciting, my stomach standing still
Like you're reading my will
He still stands in spite of what his scars say
I'll battle till this bitter finale
Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case, whoa, whoa If, if my man is fighting some unholy war
And I will stand beside you
But who you dying for?
B, I would have died too
I'd have liked to
If my man was fighting
Some unholy war
If my man was fighting I couldn't resist him
His eyes were like yours
His hair was exactly the shade of brown
He's just not as tall, but I couldn't tell
It was dark and I was lying down You are everything ' he means nothing to me
I can't even remember his name
Why're you so upset?
Baby, you weren't there and I was thinking of you when I came What do you expect?
You left me here alone; I drank so much and needed to touch
Don't overreact ' I pretended he was you
You wouldn't want me to be lonely How can I put it so you understand?
I didn't let him hold my hand
But he looked like you; I guess he looked like you
No he wasn't you
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity
It's not cheating; you were on my mind Yes he looked like you
But I heard love is blind Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
Will you love me tomorrow Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one, the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning star I'd like to know that your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now, 'cause I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans
But you were just a rich girl, and only having fun
Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pawn all your nice clothes, just living on dreams
A man in the bright lights took all that you own
Now he's taken your freedom for a date unknown But you were just a rich girl, hardly having fun
Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
And now little rich girl, I wrote this song
Hey, little rich girl my love for you is gone
And now little rich girl, I know where you belong At your dad's office party all the movies were blue
You caused him so much heartache, because the screen star was you
You left for London, when you were nineteen
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams You were a rich girl, and only having fun
But your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong?
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? Your neighbors were screaming
I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers hoping he would be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I don' wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say You were so beautiful before today
And then I heard what you say'man that was ugly The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box Take the box I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me'you know me
Feel so fucking angry, don't want to be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye'
I think I love you The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there and I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it
Take the box
Just take it, take it
Take the box
And now just take the box
Take the box Oh, lullaby by birdland that's what i
Always hear, when you sigh,
Never in my wordland could there be words to reveal
In a phrase how i feel Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo, when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love Lullaby, lullaby Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we made with our lips
When we kiss And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how i'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye Lullaby by birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in birdland, high in the sky up above
All because we're in love I should care, I should go around weeping
I should care, I should go without sleeping
Strangely enough, I sleep well
'cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep So I should care, I should let it upset me
I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do (brief instrumental interlude) I should care but it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone as lovely as you
But I should care and I do And I do I would die before I divorce you
I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
'Cause you kiss a lucky horseshoe
Stuck it in my boxing glove
'Cause anyone who will see us
Through our victory and done defeat
Knows that I'll take you to the cleaners
If you come between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh My husband is the finest handsome hustler
And he still make this housewife blush
So I'm holding my hand in his
I'm sitting on the royal flush
Women drink him in, swimming in his green eyes
Then go home and catch the chips you got
And take a bad beat to ooh to boat oh!
The jack of hearts is my jackpot Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Catch me on, have to ?
And I know as my heart beats
There's a winning secret to both
And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh
Between the cheats, ooh oh oh ooh oh oh Swing back and forth
A beautiful thing taking you away
My head is spinning My girl tried to stop me
But I had a taste of you
Unfamiliar surroundings
Left me wanting something new Physical ain't even my type
But you're one of a kind
So subconsciously on purpose
I left my coat behind I can't help it, need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too I hate my alcoholic logic
As I write this on the train
Victoria's Secret in my bag
And my thighs ache again Last night tips into my mind
Through the puddle in my head
I always get what I want
I think I even said I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Although I enjoyed it
I should have tied up my loose ends
But I left my jacket with you
And you know my friends So maybe you will get my number
Or ask them when I'm ached down
But I may have forgotten you
By the next time I'm in town I can't help, it need to stop it
All that I put myself through
Everyone is so denying
Yeah, it's nice to meet you, too Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why don't you come on over Valerie? Valerie
Valerie
Valerie Did you have to go to jail,
Put your house up for sale, did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan,
I hope you'll find the right man who'll fix it for ya
And are you shopping anywhere,
Changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
You were dodging all the time, are you still dizzy? 'Cause since I've come on home,
Well my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me

And the way you like to dress

And this you can fix. Cupid, draw back your bow.

Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.

Straight to my lovers heart for me.
Nobody but me.
Cupid, please hear my cry.
And let your arrow fly.
Straight to my lovers heart, for me Yeah, Cupid.
Oh, Cupid.
Mm mm, Cupid. When you walk in the bar,
And you dressed like a star,
Rockin' your F me pumps. And the men notice you,
With your Gucci bag crew,
Can't tell who he's lookin' to. Cause you all look the same,
Everyone knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fame. Never miss a night,
Cause your dream in life,
Is to be a footballers wife.
You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. You don't like ballers,
They don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller. You're more than a fan,
Lookin' for a man,
But you end up with one-nights-stands. He could be your whole life,
If you got past one night,
But that part never goes right. In the morning you're vexed,
He's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste. Don't be too upset,
If they call you a skank,
Cause like the news everyday you get pressed. You don't like players,
That's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire. Or them big ballers,
Don't do nothing for ya.
But you'd love a rich man six foot two or taller, You can't sit down right,
Cause you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky its ladies night. With your big empty purse,
Every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers. So you did Miami,
Cause you got there for free,
But somehow you missed the plane. You did too much E,
Met somebody,
And spent the night getting caned. Without girls like you,
There'd be no fun,
We'd go to the club and not see anyone. Without girls like you,
There's no nightlife,
All those men just go home to their wives. Don't be mad at me,
Cause you're pushing thirty,
And your old tricks no longer work. You should have known from the job,
That you always get dumped,
So dust off your fuck me pumps You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end First time I swallowed, now you're on your own
I won't return, forever you will wait You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved
You're wondering now, what to do, now you know this is the end
You're wondering how, you will pay, for the way you misbehaved Simple sweet guitar
Humbled by the bass
So when the beat kicks in
Everything falls into place
And it overpowers me
I can't help but dance
You can try to stop me now
But you won't get the chance Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Rhythm floods my heart
The melody it feeds my soul
The tune tears me apart
And it swallows me whole
You should thank your lucky stars
'Cause the music is a gift
And it's stronger than all else
Provides me with uplift Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change My lyrics revealing
Some natural vibe
Some kind of laid back feeling
Oh, just let it ride
And when Frank Sinatra sings
It's too much to take
So I sing the standard shit
It pacifies my ache Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change
See it from a different view
Half time
Time to think it through
Consider the change Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "Why did you do it with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you're on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops, and my guts churn
You shrug, and it's the worst
To truly stuck the knife in first I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good
I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
Yeah, ya know that I'm no good Got back together with my man last night
But I think I was dreaming, he didn't feel quite right
I pressed his chest under my fingertips
Beside myself I sighed and reminded of his lips I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good It's like he was designed with me in mind
He's so good from behind, he's beautifully defined
I miss him most of all when it got late
Attempt to hear him breathing or feel his shifting weight I'm confused and quizzical
Funny don'tcha know
I just wan get physical
Let me tell ya how Do me good, I'll tell you anything you want to hear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good
Do me good and all this craziness will disappear
Do me good, do me good, do me good, do me good I never wanted you to be my man
I just wanted to see what you could do, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I feel it my heart like you were there
I never wanted you, many times when I tried to set you right, it's just too hard
I never wanted you to be my man but I really couldn't control myself I can't wait to get away from you
And surprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends...right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you're home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longin'
And wondering why it's me you're (ogling) I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul
I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
And less I could have one more chance to prove, dear My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul
My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I would gladly surrender myself to you body and soul Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel
Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Nobody stands in between me and my man it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery is this? You made me Mr Slick Ricky
I thought I didn't love you when I did
I can't believe you played me out like that No you ain't worth guest lists plus one of all them girls you kissed
You can't keep lying to yourself like this
I can't believe you played yourself like this Who loves one thing but come Brixton
Nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones
What kind of fuckery are we? Nowadays you don't mean dick to me
I might let you make it up to me, who's playing Saturday What kind of fuckery are you? Besides from some of you being my best black Joe
But I could swear that we were through
I still wonder about the things you do Mr Destiny lying infinitely, nobody stands in between me and my man
'Cause it's me and Mr Jones I can see you ahead of me
But I'm not always forward thinkin'
I tell you what you want to hear
It depends on what I've been drinkin' Cause everything I do or say
Makes it hard for you to stay
We both know what it is Now-a-days we talk too much
Like your forgetting all the good shit
You decide what's wrong with me
I always used to let you say But now I like to think out loud
Your runnin' with some different crowd
We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry Mr Ultra sensitive
I'll never let myself forget you
Messed each other up you know
So I'm sorry if I upset you Tomorrow is another day
So I'll call you cause that's OK We both know what it is I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And you're attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired
I can't even cry Relationship doesn't remain
We resonate on different flames
I could cut you down again
If you were like all other men
If you were like all other men
I know that I could shut you down again
But my friend, but my friend I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I cant even cry I don't know you anymore
Supposed to be the man
That I live my life by
And your attitude become a bore
And I'm so tired I can't even cry All I can ever be to you,
Is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I had to get accustomed to,
Once it was so right,
When we were at our high,
Waiting for you in the hotel at night,
I knew I hadn't met my match,
But every moment we could snatch,
I don't know why I got so attached,
It's my responsibility,
And you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away I have no capacity He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And in this grey, in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I don't understand,
Why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand,
We could a never had it all,
We had to hit a wall,
So this is inevitable withdrawal,
Even if I stop wanting you,
A perspective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon, I shouldn't play myself again,
I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, So we are history,
Your shadow covers me
The sky above,
A blaze He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade
My tears dry on their own, I wish I could say no regrets,
And no emotional debts,
And as we kiss goodbye the sun sets,
So we are history,
The shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
In this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own, He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry on their own He walks away,
The sun goes down,
He takes the day but I'm grown,
And it's okay,
My deep shade,
My tears dry She sits home and dreams
That her man will leave his mark on her hand
He's not all he seems
But she's seen a dress, she has the flowers planned
Now she won't be happy
Till she look down and sees the engagement ring
It's for security
But she will be waiting years for her wedding [Chorus]
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
I don't hear everything I'm told He won't change her life
He just chasing tail
And wasting her time
She calls herself his wife
He calls her at 8 says be here by 9
She don't notice how when she gets the ring
It's not a good fit
So next time that they row She throws it out
It goes to the last girl he hit [Chorus] So take the gold you find
And for your own sake
Hold it in your hand
Now make sure you bite down
And watch your tooth don't break on that wedding band For me it ain't real
It's fools gold
There too many fools sold
Not an excuse oh
For me it ain't real
Yes it's fools gold Every day I see you
My hands were made for you
And you always give me stress free point of view
Pick you up after school Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Without you I'm misery
Blue without my green
All the songs sound better when you're next to me
Yeah, 'cause you come naturally Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love, love, love (Mister Magic)
I see you through the smoke Laying on my bed
I reach over for you
And you so fresh you even make the standards new
Burn the tip to get you through Mister Magic, take a token
Mister Magic, of my love
Mister Magic, I see you through the smoke Mister Magic
Mister Magic
Mister Magic, waiting for the smoke to clear
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear It's always gone within two days.
Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
So if I got it I will spend it all,
Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall. I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
I love it when it says I got the means,
To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans. Chorus: (x2)
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong,
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues. Standin' too deep at the bar today,
Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
Four white Russians a JD and Coke, Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
I'll take you out shoppin',
Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah. Chorus:
Never lasts me long,
Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes,
Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
Never lasts me long (long),
Handle finance wrong (wrong),
Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
Jazz 'n blues. Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! When she moves it's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes
Each man she passes
Goes Aaah! Oh but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
He would just give his heart gladly But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he Tall and tanned and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
He smiles
But she doesn't see
No she doesn't see
She just doesn't see Runnin' down my batt - er- ies
Layin' me out to rest
Knowin' when that is
Five hours
I wake up and de-stress
And I'm diggin' myself into a hole
And these days I just work
I will when I have so much sun CHORUS:
And lately I've forgotten who I am
Late - ely my energy's just drained away
And now..my mind..is workin' overtime
It's been a loooong day
Such a long day, ...ay, ay mmm
and while all my contempt
For every...(all my friends say)
I should take in college now
My education is dragging, dragging
innit
My guitar to London town
And the thing that wakes me
when I could sleep instead
Is the thought that to deny?
That I could fall back into bed Chorus:
And lately, I 've forgotten who I am
Late - ely, my energy's just drained away
And now...my mind....is workin' overtime
It's been a looooooooooooooong day
It's been a long day Recently my head
It ain't recharged as such
And sleep can only cure, yeah
A restless mind so much Chorus:
Lately I've forgotten who I am
Sleep too late
My energy's just drained away
And now my mind is workin' overtime
It's been a long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long long long day
It's been a long day
So long, so long, so loooooooooong Mmm yeah
Oooooh, yeah [Chorus x2:]
B boy, be my baby (won't you be my baby)
My one and only baby (be my baby now)
B boy, be my baby (be my baby now)
My one and only baby (Oh, oh, oh, oh) It was winnin' time, you know what they say
Did you think about us, did you miss your baby?
I'ma catch the train, guess I'm headin' your way
You're my number one, that's all, a newborn son
Won't you be my king? (won't you be my king?) 'Cause I know you care, I'll dirty dance for you
And when I'm done I'm gonna do it again
And when it's over I'ma pull you closer
Keep your Nikes on, you know how we do
There's nothing he won't try
We're like two stars in the sky You are my rainy day, sunshine
It's plain to see
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus] Put two in the air if you feel like me
Someone who cares feels so freaky
In demand by all the ladies
He's not for sale, he's being home-delivered to me
So hang up for your trying cards, please (he's my baby) Love-sick calls, that's what I get
I hear his voice and things get wet
Knows what I want, then he'll fetch
He's my boo and I'm his little pet, his little pet
You never know what he'll do next, he's my baby My rainy days, my sunshine
Living fantasy
My heat in the cold of Winter
Just so right for me
So won't you please [Chorus x2] Make a name for myself in different ways
All the while you will see my songs of praise
How can I concentrate when all the while my head
Throw me scenarios so I tease my self esteem
Though I can talk it through
Really I finally talk
My frustration is released but nothing let em know
And added to that Im sick of having to seek some peace
Because I need emotion with my physical release Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Now everywhere I got and I always stare
I justify attraction by your hands, your lips, your hair
And so although I always look I know that I cant touch
And because I can only take a full time man so much
And now I reached a point where I dont care anymore
Its a necessity just like it was before
Many says I ignore the way my body aches
Cause Im the shit I earn I cant look for my sins
Oh, oh, no Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
I cant help but bring it up, no
But my
Nothing, no
Cant
I cant help, no, no
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my
Words are for nothing, Im wasting my breath
Cant help
But bring it up and beat the point to death
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath Cant help
But my
Cant help
But my words are for nothing, I just keep wasting my breath You're just a little boy underneath that hat
You need your nerve to hide your ego, don't come with that
You think everything is handed to you free
But it's not that easy, no I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then My girl says I'm too sensitive to ride with you
But I'm not listening to her, mm hm
Yes I'm perceptive so when I've dance with you
You'll whisk your head back the way it were
As you were I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta know you now and then Oh, I'm not ruling you out
I'm just in doubt as to what you say you're all about, yeah I gotta know you now
We may never meet again
I gotta show you now and them
I gotta know you now and then I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again I gotta know you now
We may never meet again You should be stronger than me
You been here 7 years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man,
Not pal in comparison to who you think I am, You always wanna talk it through - I don't care!
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do - stroke my hair! 'cause' I've forgotten all of young love's joy,
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy, You should be stronger than me,
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey,
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role,
Always wanna talk it through- I'm ok,
Always have to comfort you every day,
But that's what I need you to do - are you gay? I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy He said 'the respect I made you earn -
Thought you had so many lessons to learn'
I said 'You don't know what love is - get a grip!' -
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna rip your body over mine
So tell me why you think that's a crime I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy Today my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sung a lullaby of bird land every night
Sung for my Ava every night Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise With dread I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoken 'til one day she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound
And Ava flies in paradise It begins to tell 'round midnight
'Round midnight
I do pretty well 'til after sundown
Suppertime I'm feeling sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight Memories always start 'round midnight
'Round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And old midnight knows it too When some quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darling I need you
Lately I find
You're out of my arms
And I'm out of my mind Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around Let our love take wing some midnight
'Round midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Let our love be safe and sound
When old midnight comes around He can only hold her for so long, the lights are on but no one's home
She's so vacant, her soul is taken
He thinks 'What's she running from?
Now, how can he have a heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Even if she's contenting his wants, she is played with urgency
Searches the man she misses, the man that he longs to be
Now, how can he have her heart? When it got stole
So he tries to pacify her, 'cause what's inside her never dies So he tries to pacify her, 'cause of what's inside her it never dies
So he tries to pacify her, for what's inside her never dies Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
You say, "What did you do with him today?"
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray 'Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your Stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear me down like Roger Moore I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Upstairs in bed with my ex-boy
He's in the place, but I can't get joy
Thinking of you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes Run out to meet your chips and pitter
You say when we're married 'cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told ya I was troubled
You know that I'm no good Ayo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you
Temperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you
Let me ride with you, talk about your mistakes
You cheated yourself but these are the breaks
And it never be the same again, cause of old boy
But oh boy, together we make so much joy
In the sands and oh, what a wet, wee-wee
But you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and
Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks
Now you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and
Act like we can rekindle that flame
It's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain
He that lame, you love how I bring the pain
Got the rug burns stinging and you saying my name
Say my name, that's right, I'm high post
Get the champagne, love, word up, we gon' toast I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
You know that I'm no good I cheated myself
Like I knew I would
I told you I was trouble
Yet you know that I'm no good Attracts me, till it hurts to concentrate,
Distract me, stop me doin work I hate
Just to show him how it feels;
I walk past his desk in heels
One leg resting on the chair
From the side he pulls my hair. Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculin you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel It takes me, half an hour to write a verse
He makes me imagine it from bad to worse
My weakness from the other sex
Every time his shoulders flex
The way the shirt hangs off his back
My train of thought spins right off track Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel His own style, right down to his diesel jeans
Imobile, I can't think by any means
Underwhere peeks at the top
I'll let you know where you should stop
From the picture my mind drew
I know I'd look good on you Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
Your just to hard to ignore
Masculine you spin a spell
I think you'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel Creative energy abused
All my lyrics go unused
When I clock black hair blue eyes
I drift off I fantasize Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel
Amy Amy Amy
Although I've been here before
Amy Amy Amy
He's just to hard to ignore
Masculine he spins a spell
I think he'd wear me well
Amy Amy Amy
Wheres my morel parallel I can't wait to get away from you
Unsurprisingly you hate me too
We only communicate when we need to fight
But we are best friends right? You're too good at pretending you don't care
There's enough resentment in the air
Now you don't want me in the flat
When you?re home at night
But we're best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And it's easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between Nicky's right when he says I can't win
So I don't wanna tell you anything
I can't even think about
How you feel inside
But we are best friends, right? I don't like the way you say my name
You're always looking for someone to blame
Now you want me to suffer just cause
You was born wide
But we are best friends right? You're Stephanie and I'm Paulette
You know what all my faces mean
And its easy to smoke it up, forget
Everything that happened in between So I had love for you when I was 4
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more
Someday I'll buy the Rizla, so you get the dro
'Cause we are best friends right, right, right, right?
Because we are best friends right?
Because we are best friends right? It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too if it's happened to you
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine Play all my records keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for a while
'Till johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile Judy and johnny just walked through that door
Like a queen with her king
Oh what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring Lent you outsiders and my new Badu
While you were thinking I didn't have a clue
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro red And now I feel so small discovering you knew
How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah And although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, with you next to me And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
And I'm not use to this,no no, I observe, I don't chase
So now I'm stuck with consequences, thrust in my face
And the melodramas of my day delivery blows
And that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be And although my pride's not easily disturbed
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
With your battered jeans and your Beastie tee yeah yeah
Now I can't work like this with you next to me yeah yeah His message was brutal but the delivery was kind
Maybe if I get this down I'll get it off my mind
It serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect
Didn't think you get my number down as such
But I never hated myself for my age so much yeah And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me And although my pride's, yeah, not easily disturbed, yeah
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
So with your battered jeans yeah and your Beastie tee
Now I can't work like this, no, with you next to me
