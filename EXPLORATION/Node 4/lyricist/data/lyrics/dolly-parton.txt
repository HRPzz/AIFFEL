Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you
Jolene He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name
Jolene And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me
Jolene I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene (Dolly Parton) If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, and but I know
I'll think of you each step of my way
And I will always love you
I will always love you Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need
But I will always love you
I will always love you And I hope life, will treat you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
Oh, I do wish you joy
And I wish you happiness
But above all this
I wish you love
I will always love I will always, always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you (Dolly Parton) The hills were alive with wildflowers
And I was as wild, even wilder than they
For at least I could run, they just died in the sun
And I refused to just wither in place Just a wild mountain rose, needing freedom to grow
So I ran fearing not where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were common and close, I had no room for growth
And I wanted so much to branch out So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged, I just longed to be gone
So the garden, one day, set me free I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where I'd go
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Just a wild rambling rose, seeking mysteries untold
No regret for the path that I chose
When a flower grows wild, it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Wildflowers don't care where they grow
Wildflowers don't care where they grow Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me! They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss-man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
An' the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and you never get the credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, whoa what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah they got you where they want you
There's a better life, and you dream about it, don't you?
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet 9 to 5, working 9 to 5 Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet Back through the years I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
"Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness"
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches, holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors momma made for me
Made just for me I could hold out my arms, say "I love you this much"
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing
I feel it when you're with me
It happens when you kiss me
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside
Your touch is soft and gentle
Your kiss is warm and tender
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies Love is like a butterfly
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Your laughter brings me sunshine
Everyday is spring time
And I am only happy when you are by my side
How precious is this love we share
How very precious, sweet and rare
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies Love is like a butterfly
As soft and gentle as a sigh
The multicolored moods of love are like it's satin wings
Love makes your heart feel strange inside
It flutters like soft wings in flight
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Oh, the pain of loving you
Oh, the misery I go through
Never knowing what to do
Oh, the pain of loving you You just can't stand to see me happy
Seems you hurt me all you can
Still I go on loving you
But I never understand To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go To love and hate at the same time
The line between the two is fine
The two have bound me heart and soul
So strong that I can't let you go Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was somethin' going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin' on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothin' if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
Slowly losing sight of the real thing But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one, in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Sail away
Oh, come sail away with me Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in-between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah (Dolly Parton/Porter Wagoner) Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
You bring me the sunshine when none is in sight
And when I'm in darkness, you bring me the light
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
So please, oh, please don't stop loving me You're my inspiration, my purpose in life
When things go all wrong, you make them all right
I would be useless if you ever leave
So please, oh please don't stop loving me Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't live with you gone
Please, please don't stop loving me
For I couldn't make it alone
Please, please don't stop loving me An acre of diamonds I'd offer to you
A solid gold mansion, an airplane or two
This whole world would be yours to have and to hold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold The tears that have fallen won't buy you a thing
The heartaches you've caused me won't pay for a ring
The love that I wanted would not have grown cold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold
I'd have all the riches my pockets would hold
I'd be, oh, so wealthy with treasures untold
If teardrops were pennies and heartaches were gold But teardrops aren't pennies
And heartaches aren't gold (Dolly Parton) Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain
All ye maidens hede my warning
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend
They will vow to always love you
Swear no love but yours will do
Then they'll leave you for another
Break your little heart in two Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain If I were a little sparrow
O'er these mountains I would fly
I would find him,yes I would find him
Look into his lying eyes
I would flutter all around him
On my little sparrow wings
I would ask him, yes I would ask him
Why he let me love in vain I am not a little sparrow
I am just the broken dream
Of a cold false-hearted lover
And his evil cunning scheme Little sparrow, little sparrow
Precious fragile little thing
Little sparrow, little sparrow
Flies so high and feels no pain All ye maidens fair and tender
Never trust the hearts of men
They will crush you like a sparrow
Leaving you to never mend Little sparrow, little sparrow
Oh the sorrow never ends Sometimes I try to count the ways and reasons that I love you
But I can't ever seem to count that far
I love you in a million ways and for a million reasons
More than this I love you as you are
More than this I love you as you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are my thoughts when I'm awake, my dreams when I'm asleep
You are the reason for my smile, you are the words I speak
Every role I play in life you play the leading part
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are
Ev'rything I'd ever hope to find is what you are You are my inspiration, you are the song I sing
You are what makes me happy, you are my everything
You are my daily sunshine, you are my ev'ning star
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want, that's what you are
Ev'rything I'll ever need or want is what you are You are...
You are Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down In dreams of you, my body trembles
I wake up and call your name
But you're not there, and I'm so lonesome
Without your love I'd go insane Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, little darling
Until the day they lay me down I close my eyes and you're there with me
Your kiss I feel, your face I see
It's not your lips now that drive me crazy
It's just your haunting memory Those memories of you still haunt me
Every night when I lay down
I'll always love you, my little darling
Until the day they lay me down
Until the day they lay me down Peace in the valley for me some day Well, I'm tired and so weary, but I must travel on
'Til the Lord comes and calls me away, oh, yes
Where the morning's so bright and the Lamb is the light
And the night is as bright as the day, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Well, the bear will be gentle and the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh, yes
And the beasts from the wild shall be led by a little child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh, yes There will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh, Lord, I pray
And there'll be no sadness and no sorrow, no trouble I see
Only will be peace in the valley for me, oh, yes
Yes, there will be peace, sweet peace in the valley for me, oh, yes Du-u-u Du-u-u Du-u-u-u-u-u wa Du-u wa My love for you is deeper than the depths of any ocean,
And as faithful as the stars that grace the night,
As constant as the sun making its journey through heavens,
and we'll always be together you and I. --
[Chorus]
Together you and I can stop the rain and make the sun shine.
Paint a pretty rainbow, brushed with love across the sky,
Together you and I belong, like a songbird and a song
and we'll always be together you and I
-- Life with you is sweeter than the fragrance of the flowers
And as happy as the laughter of a child
As peaceful as a river and as lasting as forever
you know we'll always be together you and I [Chorus] I always be beside or close behind you.
Wherever you go, you'll always know I'll always find you [Chorus] We'll always be together, you and I Forever together, forever you and I
(forever you and I du-du)
Forever together, together you and I will always be
(together, together)
Together, you and I........ You say tomorrow you're going
It's so hard for me to believe
I'm making plans for the heartaches
'Cause you're making plans to leave The tears for me will be falling
Like a tree shedding its leaves
I'm making plans for the tear drops
'Cause you're making plans to leave You're making plans to forget me
I'm making plans to miss you
I'm getting ready to grieve I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave I'm making plans to be lonesome
'Cause you're making plans to leave Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever think back on old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night
Because you miss me, do you darling
Oh, and do your memories ever take
You back into another place in time
Oh, do you ever miss the feelings
And the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling
I just wonder do I cross your mind Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close Chorus: And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time
Do you ever recall these old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind Do you ever ... (Floyd Parton) I'll do everything I can to make you proud to be my man
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
I guess we're promising a lot, but for now it's all we've got
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years I'll be your friend, I'll be your lover
Until the end, there'll be no other
'Cause my heart has only room for one
Yes, I'll always love you, and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side we'll be together always
And if you'll hold me tight when you love me
That's all I'll ask of you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Rockin' chairs, rockin' babies, rock-a-bye, rock of ages
Side by side, we'll be together always
And, yes, I'll always love you and I'll always be here for you
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years, and I'll be here
And I'll stand by you through our rockin' years Through our rockin' years I want to feel this way
Longer than time
I want to know your dreams
And make them mine
I want to change the world
Only for you
All the impossible
I want to do I want to hold you close under the rain
I want to kiss your smile
And feel your pain
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
Here in a world of lies
You are the true [Chorus:]
And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you
Anything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me I want to make you see
Just what i was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does
You walked into my life
To stop my tears
Everything's easy now
I have you here [Repeat chorus]
In a world without you
I would always hunger
All i need is your love to make me stronger [Repeat chorus] (Dolly Parton) Sittin' on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a straightback chair on two legs, leans against the wall
Watch the kids a' playin' with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin' fireflies when evenin' shadows fall In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads it's wings
An' a songbird on a fence post sings a melody In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by Walkin' home from church on a Sunday with the one ya' love
Just laughin', talkin', making future plans
And when the folks ain't lookin', you might steal a kiss or two
Sittin' in the porch swing, holdin' hands In my Tennessee mountain home
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh
In my Tennessee mountain home
Crickets sing in the fields near by (Dolly Parton/Carl Perkins) When it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, you accept them, 'cause you have no choice but to
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
And they always put you to the test
And you always try to do your best
And just pray for God to do the rest, when it's family Some are preachers, some are gay
Some are addicts, drunks and strays
But not a one is turned away, when it's family
Some are lucky, others ain't
Some are fighters, others faint
Winners, losers, sinners, saints, it's all family And when it's family you trust them and your heart's an open door
When it's family, you tolerate what you'd kill others for
When it's family, you love and hate and take, then give some more
Somehow you justify mistakes, try to find some better way
To solve the problems day to day, in the family You take the trouble as it comes and love them more than anyone
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family
You choose your lovers, you pick your friends
Not the family that you're in, nah
They'll be with you 'til the end, 'cause it's family And when it's family, you forgive them for they know not what they do
When it's family, they're a mirror of the worst and best in you
When it's family, when it's family
Let me be all that I should be to the family (Dolly Parton) Well a good ways down the railroad track
There was this little old rundown shack
And in it lived a man I'd never seen
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man
And you better not set foot on his land
I didn't think nobody could be that mean
So I took me out walking down the railroad track
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true
There was a big black dog laying out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say well who are you
Oh and there he stood in the door of that shack
His beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen
When he spoke his voice was low and deep
But he just didn't frighten me
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean
He said what you doing snooping 'round my place
And I saw a smile come across his face
So I smiled back and I told him who I was
He said come on in and pull you up a chair
You might as well since you already here
And he said you can call me Joshua
Joshua Joshua
Whatcha doing living here all alone
Joshua Joshua
Ain't you got nobody to call your own
No no no no We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight
And we still talking when it come daylight
And there was just so much we had to say hey
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home
And just like him I was all alone
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay
Oh we grew closer as time went on
And that little old shack it was a happy home
And we just couldn't help but fall in love
That big black dog and that little old shack
Sitting down by the railroad track
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua Joshua Joshua
Why you're just what I've been looking for
Joshua Joshua
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore
No no Yodel-a-he-ho Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua
Me and Joshua yeah yeah
Me and Joshua (Dolly Parton) Take my hand and run with me
Out of the past of yesterday
And walk with me into the future of tomorrow
Yesterday must be forgot
No looking back no matter what
There's nothing there but mem'ries that bring sorrow Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever No more crying tears leave tracks
And mem'ries find their way back
Tomorrow's waiting let's journey there together Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever I care not for yesterday I love you as you are today
Yesterday just helped to pass the time while waiting
We must forget the passing time
My love for you is the real kind
The kind that won't hurt you, oh never Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever
Yesterday is gone, gone, but tomorrow is forever Well, I wish that I was on old Rocky Top
Down in the Tennessee hills
Cause there ain't no smog, no smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bill Now but once I had me a man on Rocky Top
Half bear the other half cat
Well, he was wild as a mink but he was sweet as soda-pop
I often think about that Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Lookin' for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
And some say they never will Did you know corn don't grow at all on Rocky Top?
The dirt's too rocky by far
And that's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Now I've had years of cramped up city life
Trapped luck a duck in a pen
All I know is it's a dad-burn pity
Life can't be simple again Oh, Rocky Top, you'll always be
Home sweet home to me
Good ol' Rocky Top
Rocky Top, Tennessee, Rocky Top, Tennessee Rocky Top, Tennessee
Tennessee, Rocky Top It's a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin'
In your hand, in your hand Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
As we walk along my thoughts are tumblin'
Round and round, round and round Underneath our feet are someplace rumblin'
Underground, underground
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind I've got reason a plenty for goin
This i know, this i know
The weeds have been steadily growin'
Please don't go, please don't go Are you going away
With no word of farewell
Will there be not a trace left behind
I could've loved you better Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind
Are you going away
With no word of farewell Will there be not a trace left behind
Oh i could've loved you better
Didn't mean to be unkind
You know that was the last thing on my mind You know that was the last thing on my mind (Dolly Parton) Daddy was an old time preacher man
He preacher the word of God throughout the land
He preached so plain a child could understand
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
He told the people of he need to pray
He talked about God's wrath and judgement day
He preached about the great eternity
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man
Aunt Leanona would get up to testify
And we'd sing "In The Sweet By And By"
The we'd sing "I'm On My Way To Canaan Land"
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved it's worth it all
But the aisles were always filled at altar calls
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man Daddy worked for God but asked for no pay
For he believed that God provides a way
We never had a lot but we got by
Guess it's 'cause the Lord was on Daddy's side
Yes, Daddy was an old time preacher man [Spoken] I've always been misunderstood because of how I look.
Don't judge me by the cover 'cause I'm a real good book.
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am.
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam. I grew up poor and ragged, just a simple country girl.
I wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world,
like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks' catalog.
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all.
I'm just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair.
Don't be fooled by thinkin' that the goods are not there.
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that
I'm as shallow as I look 'cause I run true and deep. I'm just a backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels.
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real.
Yes, I can see where I may be misjudged upon first glance.
But even backwoods Barbies deserve a second chance. All dolled up and hopin' for a chance to prove my worth,
'Cuz even backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt. To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him
Is to love love love him
And I do I'll be good to him
I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day
When I'll walk alongside of him
Yes, just to know him
Is to love love love him
And I do Why can't he see
How blind can he be
Someday he will see
That he was meant for me, ooh To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
Just to see him smile
Makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him
Is to love love love him
And I do When the mornin' sun
Streaks across my room
And I'm wakin' up
From another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road
Once again it seems
All that's left behind
Is a chain of broken dreams But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you And how I wish that love
Was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have
'Cause I've got so much to give
But ya' know I feel so sad
Down inside my heart
That the dollar sign
Should be keepin' us apart But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life
Had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come runnin' back to you
I'd come runnin' back to you But you know we can't
Live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent
So I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this travelin' life
Well, it's the only life I know But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you But you know I love you
But you know I love you
Oh, I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
But you know that I love you
But you know that I love you If she brings you happiness
Then I wish you both the best
It's your happiness that matters most of all
But if she ever breaks your heart
If the teardrops ever start
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls Though it hurts to let you go
Darling I want you to know
I'll run to you if ever you should call
And if I should ever hear
That she's made you shed a tear
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls I'll be there anytime you need me by your side
To dry away each teardrop you've cried
If she ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls All I Estare Candor me necesites a tu lado
Para borrar cadda lagrima que haya llorado
If he ever leaves you blue
Just remember I love you
And I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls I'll be there, I'll be there
Before the next teardrop falls (Dolly Parton) My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
But with a little mending it could be as good as new
Why you take for instance this old broken heart
If you will just replace the missing parts
You would be surprised to find how good it really is
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I will guarantee you'll be completely satisfied Take these old used memories from the past
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore
I've wasted love but I still have some more The bargain store is open come inside
You can easily afford the price
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied My life is like unto a bargain store
And I may have just what you're lookin' for
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used
With a little mendin' it could be as good as new The bargain store is open, come inside
The bargain store is open, come inside There's a wreath on the door
She don't live here no more
As of today, she flew home
And we all gathered here
In sorrow and tears
It won't be the same with her gone
There's a place on the hill
That's peaceful and still
Where she'll sleep beside daddy again
The ole' family tree is shedding it's leaves
But we'll all met in heaven again Chorus: Oh, she's an angel
Let her fly, let her fly
She's gone home to glory
To her home in the sky
When God sees her comin'
Heaven's choir will smile
And sing, "oh she's an angel, let her fly, let her fly
Ooh, she's an angel, let her fly" She used to rock me when I was a child
Sing "rock of ages" and "in the sweet bye and bye"
Her life wasn't easy, oh but how hard she tried
You know she's an angel, lord, so let her fly Repeat chorus Tag: Let her fly
Ooh she's an angel, let her fly I can't forget you
Ever since the moment that I met you
You've been on my mind
And I need to somehow let you know
That I think about you all the time [Chorus:]
So when you think about love, think about me
I can give you more than you'll ever need
Sooner or later every heart needs some company
When you think about love, think about me
When you think about love, think about me We were strangers
Now I'm already wrapped around your finger
Oh what's a heart to do
'Cause it lingers
And the thought of you
Wantin' me as much as I want you [Chorus] Makes me blue
I'm not holding you tonight
'Cause only you can satisfy
This heart of mine [Chorus] Well, good morning, Captain
Good morning to you, Sir
Hey hey yeah Do you need another mule skinner
Down on your new mud run?
Hey hey yeah Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well I'm a lady mule skinner
From down old Tennessee way
Hey hey, I come from Tennessee I can make any mule listen
Or I won't accept your pay
Hey hey I won't take your pay Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, hey hey, little water boy
Won't you bring your water 'round?
Hey hey If you don't like your job
Well, you can throw your bucket down
Throw it down boy, throw it down Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he Well, I've been working down in Georgia
At a greasy spoon cafe
Hey, 've been working in Georgia
Just to let a no good man Call every cent of my pay
Hey hey and I'm sick of it
And wanna be a mule skinner Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Yodel-a-ee-he-he
He-he-he-he-he-he
Mule skinner blues (Traditional) In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
My love, my love, what have I done
To make you treat me so
You've caused me to weep, you've caused me to mourn
You've caused me to leave my home In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows The longest train I ever saw
Went down that Georgia Line
The engine passed at six o'clock
The caboose went by at nine In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows I asked my captain for the time of day
He said he throwed his watch away In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo (Dolly Parton) He lived by the apple orchard in this little orchard shack
His real name was Jackson Taylor but I called him AppleJack
Now old AppleJack was loved by everyone he ever knew
AppleJack picked apples but he picked the banjo too Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Now I'd go down to AppleJack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old AppleJack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old AppleJack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it I still hear AppleJack Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me AppleJack, AppleJack
Play a song, let your banjo ring It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now It's too bad
You say you need me and it's too bad
I know the feelin' and it's so sad
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my dreams around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you want me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried
To hold out just for you?
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life
Turned my world around
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late
You say you need me and it's too late
Once my love for you was so great
But it's too late to love me now
It's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl
Sat by an old church door
The little girl's feet
Were as brown as the curl
That fell on the dress that she wore
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn
They shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home
To you mommy I said
And this was the maddens reply
Mommy's in heaven
Angels took her away
Left Tim and I all alone
We've no one to love us
And daddy is dead
And our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick
Angels took her away
To dwell in those mansions so bright
She said she would come
For her children some day
And I guess she's coming tonight
The sexton came early
To ring the church bell
And found them
Beneath the snow white
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell
Up in heaven with their mommy that night (Dolly Parton) She's been there, God knows, she's been there
She has seen and done it all
She's a woman, she know how to
Dish it out or take it all
Her heart's as soft as feathers
Still she weathers stormy skies
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors
You can toss her around and round
You can keep her in you vision
But you'll never keep her down
She's a lover, she's a mother
She's a friend and she's a wife
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia
Strong as steel, her faith and pride
She's an everlasting shoulder
She's the leaning post of life
She hurts deep and when she weeps
She's just as fragile as a child
And she's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken
But she's an eagle when she flies
Oh, bless her, Lord
She's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that let me down Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman No, my mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry
One we made some time ago
When they ask who's in the picture with me
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I used to spend some time with
Just a flame, that's lost its glow
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" Just someone, I use to run around with
Just a friend from long ago
I don't tell them, how lost I am without you
I say just "Someone I use to know" I say just "Someone I use to know" (Dolly Parton) Momma never seemed to miss the finer things in life
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife
If she did, she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life
Was to make our house a home and make us happy
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had
If she did, she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone
She didn't mind the stayin' home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy
And she never missed the flowers
And the gifts he never gave her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted
And she didn't need those things to make her happy
She didn't even seem to notice
That he didn't kiss and hold her
If she did, she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke
Just to find the note
That momma carefully wrote
And left to daddy
And as he began to read it
Our ears could not believe it
The words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough
And they don't need me very much
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly
I have needed you so long
But I just can't keep holdin' on
She never meant to come back home
If she did, she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone
Good-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way
And many dreams have withered on the vine
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now
We'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through
Happiness is knowing that you're mine
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come
We'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness
We'll just live our lives one day at a time
[ guitar ]
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world
We may leave little marks in life's design
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...
We'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning
I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more
Than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me
Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
Now most every morning
I stare out the window
I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more
Than I needed before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
Yes, you left me
Just when I needed you most
You packed in the morning I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way Now I love you more
Than I loved you before
And now where I'll find comfort, god knows
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most
You left me
Just when I needed you most
Oh, you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin'
The years have shown no kindness
For the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream
And still go right on bluffin'
With really nothin' left to hold onto Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken
Victims of a passion, much too strong to be denied
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin'
God only knows how long, how hard we've tried Oh, why do we keep holding on
With nothing left to hold onto
Let's be honest with each other
That's the least that we can do
I feel guilty when they envy me and you
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE

Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes and lie those pretty lies
And pretty soon I'm wond'rin how I came to doubt you. All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again and here I go All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there got all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
Here you come again lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again, and here I go, here I go
And here I go
And here I go
Here you come again and here I go
Here I go You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still
The day I met you my heart spoke to me
It said to love you through eternity Now knowing that you were another's bride
I vowed I'll always be close by your side
You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still You broke a heart dear that would die for you
I'd give this world dear to belong to you
The game is over now and we've both lost
A broken heart will have to pay the cost You know I love you and I always will
I know you're married but I love you still I love you so much I can't let you go
And sometimes I believe you love me
But somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a door without any key Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a window that I can't see through
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky
Somewhere between me and you
[ steel ]
Somewhere between your heart and mine
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile
And I'm left in the middle again Somewhere between your heart and mine... You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun

But while we're apart, don't give your heart to anyone
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it with your touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you, oh, so much You can dance
Go and carry on till the night is gone
Till it's time to go
If she asks
If you're all alone, can she take you home
You got to tell her no And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me Ooh darling, save the last dance for me
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that hold your hand
In the pale moonlight
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in who's arms you're gonna be

Even death could never end this love of mine I have loved you for so long
With a love both true and strong

Even death could never end this love of mine
If you go, I'll follow you.... With great anticipation he waited at the door
His only son was due from overseas
For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home, son
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long.
I hear him say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." But a dreary rain was falling while another soldier fell
And a mother wakes up crying in the night
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell
Her only son had passed into the light Welcome home, son
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love
Welcome home, son
As Jesus stood there glowing, their hands reached out and touched
I knew that you'd return to me
The place that you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
As they embraced I heard him say
"I've waited so long for this day
My son, my very own... Welcome home." Now I think of all the families that have lost a darling one
And I think how Jesus died for all our sins
And I think how much God loved us to send his only son
To live and die, and then to live again Welcome home son
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day
Welcome home son
And when he sent his angels to roll that stone away
I knew that you'd return to me
The place where you were meant to be
Rest now, for you've been gone too long
I hear God say as they embrace
"I've waited so long for this day
Well done my faithful son... Welcome home." Welcome home!
I hope to hear God saying when it's my time to go!
Welcome home!
While the angel band is playing and God comes to claim my soul!
The angels will be singing and joybells will be ringing!
Rejoicing! I'll shout and sing along!
When there are no more wars to fight
And we're all children of the light
When the father and the son say
"Welcome home!" Tag: Welcome home, welcome home, welcome home. You ought to go north somebody told us
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd spent our lives on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams all fell in on us
'Cause there was no land of promise
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh, and these northern nights are dreary
My old southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I know that they all love me
And I know they're thinking of me
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately
About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
Lord, you go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh, and these northern nights they're dreary
These old southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
I know He'll love and guide and lead us
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father
He'll keep my heads above the water
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong
My home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time
But that was before I met you
I never saw one that I wanted for mine
But that was before I met you
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free
But that was before I met you
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me
But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail
I thought I could never be blue
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved
But that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day
Writing a letter to pass time away
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee
Saying won't you please write a letter for me
Oh, what must I say in this letter I pray
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail
Her big eyes were shining, her little face pale
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way
And when she stepped out Never looked either way
A big object hit her and sped away fast
The little girls prayers had been answered at last
The postman was passing
And picked up the note
Addressed to the master
And these words he spoke
Strait up into heave this letter did go
She's happy up there with her mommy I know (Dolly Parton) Hello you said the day we met
Handing me a yellow rose
You asked me out
And to your surprise
And to mine I said I'd go
I thought it so romantic
And I found you sweet and bold
Though we'd only met
I still said yes
To a single yellow rose And for years to come
You were the one
To sleep with me at night
To laugh and talk
And share my thoughts
And hold me when I'd cry
And on every occasion
And for no good reason to
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose
Was sent from you Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so I never see a yellow rose
That I didn't think of you
It's still my favorite flower
Though the yellow's turned to blue
The day you left my teardrops fell
Upon your farewell not
You said goodbye like you said hello
With a single yellow rose Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
Oh I still love you so Yellow roses
The color of sunshine
You loved me at one time
Why did you have to go
Sweet yellow roses
Are you sending your new love
My bright yellow rose buds
I still love you so Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're not aware that I'm around
Here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry
But they're having a party just two doors down I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever
I think I'd really rather join 'em two doors down Two doors down we're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down they're all aware that I'm around
Here I am no longer crying and feeling sorry
We're having a party just two doors down I can't believe I'm standing here dry-eyed, all smiles & talkin'
Making conversation with the new love I've found
I ask him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down,yeah Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down
Oh oh oh oh two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
'Cause here I am feeling everything but sorry
We're having our own party two doors down Two doors down they're laughing and drinking and having a party
And two doors down we're not aware that they're around
Here I end feeling everything but sorry (Dolly Parton) Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear me, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help me like before?
I have questioned your existence,
My resistance leaves me cold
Can you help me go the distance?
Hello God, hello, hello This old world has gone to pieces
Can we fix it, is there time?
Hate and violence just increases
We're so selfish, cruel and blind
We fight and kill each other
In your name, defending you
Do you love some more than others?
We're so lost and confused Hello God, are you out there?
Can you hear us, are you listenin' any more?
Hello God, if we're still on speakin' terms
Can you help us like before?
Oh, the free will you have given
We have made a mockery of
This is no way to be livin',
We're in great need of your love
Hello God Hello God, can you grant us
Love enough to make amends
(Hello God) Is there still a chance
That we could start again
Hello God, we've learned our lesson
Dear God, don't let us go
More than ever
Hello God, hello, hello
Hello God, we really need you
We can't make it without you
(Hello God) We beseech you
In the name of all that's true
Hello God, please forgive us
For we know not what we do Hello God, give us one more chance to prove ourselves to you
Hello, God; hello, God Nobody believes that I really care for you
They don't think my heart is true
I don't think you agree
You know I'm a lifetime gaurantee So if they ask you what you mean to me
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go on and tell 'em baby Nobody believes we got somethin' they ain't got
They've never seen a fire this hot
They never got that far
We're burning as bright as any star
So if they ask you what your feelings are Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything
Go ahead and tell 'em baby Feels so good, holding tight
Loving you through the night
Oh and they can call it what they like
But they ain't got it right
No, no, no Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We've got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell them you're my everything
Oooo... Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough
Just tell 'em you're my everything Oh, oh, oh
Don't call it love
Heaven's above
We got a better thing, baby
Don't call it love
'Cause that ain't enough I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? I am a vessel that's empty and useless
I am a bad seed that fell by the way
I am a loser that wants to be a winner
And you are my last hope
Don't turn me away I am a seeker, a poor sinful creature
There is no weaker than I am
I am a seeker, you are a teacher
You are a reacher, so reach down Won't you reach out and lead me
Guide me and keep me, Lord
In the shelter of your care each day
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Oh, I know you are a mountain
From which there flows a fountain
So let it's water wash my sins away
'Cause I am a seeker, you are a keeper
You are the leader, won't you show me the way? Happy, happy birthday baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
Cause that's when we fell in love Do you remember
The names we had for each other
I was your pretty
You were my baby
Oh, how could we say goodbye Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy happy birthday baby (Dolly Parton) Well I met a boy from Grassy Branch
Fine as he can be
I met him at the big barn dance
And he took a shine to me
Sky-blue eyes, a big wide smile
And tall as a sycamore tree
He's real smart with a real big heart
And he's gonna marry me
He's gonna marry me
And we're gonna go to town
We're gonna buy some real good car
And we're gonna drive around
We'll hold hands an' touch 'n' hug
He talks so sweet to me
Cause he knows a lot about love and stuff
And he's gonna marry me His momma don't like me one little bit
But you know I don't care
Let her pitch her hissy-fit
Cause I ain't a'marryin' her
He's always been a momma's boy
It's just plain jealousy
She's as mad as an old wet hen
Cause he's gonna marry me Oh, an' he's gonna marry me
An' he's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he done kiss me on the mouth
An' he's gonna marry me Yeah, he's gonna marry me
He's gonna buy me a ring
We're gonna be so free
Cut momma's apron strings
He's gonna build me a pretty little house
Have a pretty little babe of three
Cause he's done kiss me on the mouth
So he's gotta marry me
Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth
And he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred
And all the windows fastened down
I spent the night in sleeplessness
And rose at every sound
Half in hope of sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breakin' through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us know where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I fell down on my knees
And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt in my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive yes He's alive
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive
Hallelujah He's alive
He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive He's alive He's alive
I believe it He's alive
Sweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place
For a country girl with a friendly face
If you smile people look at you funny, they take it wrong
The greenest state in the land of the free
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite
Life ain't as simple as it used to be
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me
And Lord, I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon
Daddy you can load the rifles up
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when
If I had it all to do over again
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed
Good Lord, have mercy on a country girl
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head
Tennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten
Just sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies
Sittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby
Sittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces
Sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten
Sittin' on the front porch swing
Sittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin'
"Dolly, what's your secret?
With all you do, your attitude
Just seems to be so good
How do you keep it?"
Well, I'm not the Dalai Lama, but I'll try
To offer up a few words of advice. Chorus:
You better get to livin', givin'
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin'
And lovin' on the way
You better get to knowin', showin'
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin'
Just a word unto the wise
You better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening
She was spinnin' such a sad tale
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin'
So negative the words she had to say
I said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin', givin'
Be willing and forgivin'
Cause all healing has to start with you
You better stop whining, pining
Get your dreams in line
And then just shine, design, refine
Until they come true
And you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck, your house is mess
And your wardrobe way outdated
All your plans just keep on falling through
Overweight and under paid, under appreciated
I'm no guru, but I'll tell you
This I know is true. You better get to livin', givin'
A little more thought about bein'
A little more willin' to make a better way
Don't sweat the small stuff
Keep your chin up
Just hang tough
And if it gets too rough
Fall on your knees and pray
And do that everyday
Then you'll get to livin'. The day we're born we start to die
Don't waste one minute of this life
Get to livin'
Share your dreams and share your laughter
Make some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin'
Better start sharin'
Better start tryin'
Better start smiling
And you better get to livin'... (Dolly Parton) Say forever you'll be mine
Forever is the love that is filled with understanding
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine Trouble clouds may fill our skies
It might even rain awhile
But the rain will go away
There's always a brighter day Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine
Say forever you'll be mine, forever I am yours
And I'll do anything that you ever ask me to
And I'll do what you want me to Darling, I won't promise you
That we'll be happy all the time
But forever I am yours, say forever you'll be mine (Dolly Parton) Late one cold and stormy night I heard a dog a' barkin'
Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin'
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms
Before I could say a word she said, 'My name is Sandy
And this here is my puppy dog, it's name is little Andy'
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little Andy
Patty cake and bakersman
My mommy ran away again
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill
Can we stay all night
If you don't love us no one will
I promise we won't cry
London bridge is fallin' down
My daddy's drunk again in town
And we was all alone and didn't what we could do
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven
But that night as they slept the angels took them both to heaven
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone Ain't ya got no gingerbread
Ain't ya got no candy
Ain't ya got an extra bed for me and little (whispers) Andy (Dolly Parton) Hello, are you free tonight
I like your looks, I love your smile
Could I use you for a while,
It's all wrong, but it's all right The amber sunset glow has died
My needs are very much alive
Is it ok if I stop by
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It may be wrong if we make love
But I just need someone so much
And who knows it might last for life
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and fantasize
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right
Just close your eyes and hold me tight
Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right It's all wrong, but it's all right

Tell me sexy lovin' lines
It's all wrong, but it's all right Oooh,OOh,Oooh-ooh,Oh,Oh,Oh,Oh-oh-oh-oh.
Well, I can't tell you where I'm going
I'm not sure of where I've been
But I know I must keep travelin'
Till my road comes to an end I'm out here on my journey
Trying to make the most of it

Where all my pieces fit Chorus Like a poor wayfairing stranger

You're gonna see a change in me God made me for a reason
And nothing is in vain
Redemption comes in many shapes
With many kinds of pain Oh, sweet Jesus if you're out there
Keep me ever close to you

And it's hard to travelin' on
But hold in to each other
We don't have to work alone
When everything is broken
We can mend it if we try
We can make the world a difference
If we want to we can fllly.
Good-bye you little children
Good-night you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies
And to all who knew me when...
And I hope I'll see ya down the road
You meant more than I knew

Redemption comes in many shapes with many kinds of pain
Oh sweet Jesus if you're listening, keep me ever close to you
As I'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin', as I'm travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Oh sometimes the road is rugged, and it's hard to travel on
But holdin' to each other, we don't have to walk alone
When everything is broken, we can mend it if we try
We can make a world of difference, if we want to we can fly Goodbye little children, goodnight you handsome men
Farewell to all you ladies and to all who knew me when
And I hope I'll see you down the road, you meant more than I knew
As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin'
Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind
Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru Like the poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home
Oh sweet Jesus if you're out there, keep me ever close to you
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', as I'm travelin' thru Momma moved out
Daddy sold the house
They split up the money
And went on their way
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn't put mommy and daddy back together again Starting over again
Where should they begin
Cause they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries Got an apartment
She moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home
Just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories
From thirty odd years Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk, it's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Making up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And all the king's horses
And all the king's men
Could never put mommy and daddy back together
Back together, again (Dolly Parton) Chorus:
Love is pretty when love is new
Like a blushing rose in a dazzling dew,
Intoxicating like cherry sweet wine.
When love is new it's magic. Verse 1: Mother, oh Mother, why can't you see
He's the only love for me.
Why must thou be opposed to me
I'm asking for thy blessing. Daughter, oh daughter, I know his kind.
You think he's handsome, you think he's fine.
He'll use your body and tangle your mind;
Too late you'll learn this lesson Repeat Chorus When love grows cold, it's tragic Verse 2: Mother, oh mother, he's not that way
His touch just takes my breath away.
You surely remember when you felt that way
When you and father first married Oh, yes, I do remember it well.
What first was heaven soon turned to hell
He left with another the year you were born.
I told you he's dead and buried. Repeat Chorus Bridge: He'll love me true 'cause he told me so.
He'll break you heart when love grows old.
I must go, Mother, I must go.
Then, daughter, why are you asking?
I love him so, I love him so.
Then I pray you're new love's lasting. Repeat Chorus Tag: When love grows cold, it's tragic.
