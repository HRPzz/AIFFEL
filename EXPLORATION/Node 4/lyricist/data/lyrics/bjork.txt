In the shape of a girl
You're the bird on the brim
Hypnotized by the Whirl Drink me, make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we're playing is life
Love is a two way dream Leave me now, return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay I'm a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You're the one who walks me
I'm your one way street I'm a whisper in water
Secret for you to hear
You are the one who grows distant
When I beckon you near Leave me now, return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go astray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay I'm a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You're the intruder hand
I'm the branch that you break
Hum-yeah! I remember you
You're the one
That made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago I remember you
You're the one
That said, "I love you too
Didn't you know?" I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain, out of the blue When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
I shall tell them I remember you I remember you
You're the one
That made my dreams come true
A few kisses ago I remember you,
You're the one
That said, "I love you too
Didn't you know?" I remember too
A distant bell
And stars that fell
Like rain, out of the blue When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
I shall tell them I remember you Oh, you
Oh, you
You All these accidents
That happen
Follow the dot
Coincidence Makes sense
Only with you
You don't have to speak
I feel Emotional landscapes
They puzzle me
Then the riddle gets solved
And you push me up to this State of emergency
How beautiful to be
State of emergency
Is where I want to be All that no-one sees
You see
What's inside of me
Every nerve that hurts You heal
Deep inside of me, oo-oohh

How beautiful to be Your flirt finds me out
Teases the crack in me
Smittens me with hope Possibly maybe possibly maybe
possibly maybe As much as I definitely enjoy solitude
I wouldn't mind perhaps
Spending little time with you
Sometimes
Sometimes Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love Uncertainty excites me
babe
Who knows what's going to happen?
Lottery or car crash
Or you'll join a cult Probably maybe possibly love
Probably maybe possibly love, possibly Mon petit vulcan
You're eruptions and disasters
I keep calm admiring your lava
I keep calm Possibly maybe probably love
Possibly maybe probably love Electric shocks?
I love them!
With you, dozen a day
But after a while I wonder
Where's that love you promised me?
Where is it? Possibly maybe probably love, possibly
Possibly maybe probably love, possibly How can you offer me love like that?
My heart's burned
How can you offer me love like that?
I'm exhausted
Leave me alone Possibly maybe possibly maybe
Possibly maybe Since we broke up
I'm using lipstick again
I suck my tongue
In remembrance of you Pedaling through
The dark currents
I find
An accurate copy
A blueprint
Of the pleasure
In me A secret code carved, a secret code carved He offers
A handshake
Crooked
Five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry Morsecoding signals
They pulsate and wake me up
From my hibernating On the surface simplicity
But the darkest pit in me
It's pagan poetry
Pagan poetry I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him This time
I'm gonna keep it to myself This time
I'm gonna keep me all to myself
And he makes me want to hurt myself again And he makes me want to hurt myself again While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love
In a ball of yarn He'll never return it
So when you come back
We'll have to make new love He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love While you are away
My heart comes undone
Slowly unravels
In a ball of yarn The devil collects it
With a grin
Our love, our love,
In a ball of yarn He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love He'll never return it
When you come back
We'll have to make new love When your eyes
Pause on the ball
That hangs on the third branch from a star,
You remember why it got dark
And why it is getting light again.
The Earth (like the heart) leans back in it's seat
And, like that, it travels along an orbit
Drawn in the darkness.
Unpolished pearl In sky-black
Palm of hands
Flickering sun-flame.
You remember
That you are yourself a light-bearer,
Who receives her radiance from others She lives in this house over there
Has her world outside it
Scrabbles in the earth with her fingers enter mouth
She's five years old Threads worms on a string
Keeps spiders in her pocket
Collects fly-wings in a jar
Scrubs horse flies and, and pinches them on a line She has one friend, he lives next door
They listen into the weather
He knows how many freckles she's got
She scratches his beard She's painting huge books
And glues them together
They saw a big raven
It glided down the sky, she touched it Today is her birthday
They're smoking cigars
He got a chain of flowers
And sows a bird in her knickers They, they're smoking cigars
They lie in the bathtub
And chain of flowers Come to me, I'll take care of you
Protect you, calm, calm down
You're exhausted, come lay down
You don't have to explain, I understand You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm Jump off, your building's on fire
And I'll catch you, I'll catch you
Destroy all that is keeping you down
And then I'll nurse you, I'll nurse you I'll protect you You know that I adore you
You know that I love you
So don't make me say it
It would burst the bubble
Break the charm All the modern things
Like cars and such
Have always existed
They've just been waiting in a mountain
For the right moment
Listening to the irritating noises
Of dinosaurs and people
Dabbling outside Kahi
Engin fylgist alveg
Kahiiiiiii
Sólin sekkur
Kahi
Engin sér við mér Það er sól thegar Andar inn í mér
Hann bítur mig
Hann bítur mig
Já, hann kemur með

They've just been waiting
To come out
And multiply
And take over
It's their turn now Kahi
Engin fylgist alveg
Kahiiiiiii
Sólin sekkur
Kahi
Engin sér við mér So broken,
In pieces,
My heart is so broken,
I'm puzzling. Here I go
Trying to run ahead of that,
Heart break train,
Thinking,
It will never catch up with me. I'm so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
So broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm,
heðan-biður,
Wooh-ahhh-hmm I'm trying to land,
This aeroplane of ours gracefully,
But it seems just destined to crash, I'm so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
My heart is so broken,
heðan-biður-afte-care,
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm, How can, how can,
And I sense
All continuity
Has vanished away
At one step at a time now baby, baby
I'm so broken
heðan-liður-afte-care
I'm-m-m-mmm...so broken
heðan-biður-afte-care
Yeah, ha-ee, ha-ee, ha-mmm I'm so
Completely unhealable, baby

If travel is searching
And home has been found I'm not stopping
I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'll bring back the goods
But I don't know when I thought I could organize freedom
How Scandinavian of me En-cha-le-li
En-cha-le
You sussed it out, didn't you?
Yeah! You could smell it
So you left me on my own
To complete the mission
Now I'm leaving it all behind I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter, I'm the hunter
I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter, I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter, I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
Ooh Sunday is gloomy, the hours are slumberless
Dearest of shadows I live with are numberless
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the dark coach of sorrow has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you? Gloomy Sunday Gloomy Sunday, with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be prayers and candles are lit, I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go Death is a dream, for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul, I'll be blessing you Gloomy Sunday Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I awake and I find you asleep and deep in my heart dear
Darling, I hope that my dream hasn't haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I wanted you Gloomy Sunday
It's absolutely gloomy Sunday
Gloomy Sunday Dear Gene,
of course you are here
and now there's nothing to fear Oooh, I should have known
Oooh, I was never alone This isn't the last song
there's no violin
the choir is so quiet
and no-one takes a spin
this is the next to last song
and that's all
all Remember what I have said
remember, wrap up the bread
do this, do that, make your bed This isn't the last song
there's no violin
the choir is quiet
and noone takes a spin
this is the next to last song
and that's all We live on a mountain
Right at the top
There's a beautiful view
From the top of the mountain
Every morning I walk towards the edge
And throw little things off
Like car-parts, bottles and cutlery
Or whatever I find lying around
It's become a habit
A way to start the day I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you It's real early morning
No-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
Still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
On their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
Imagine what my body would sound like
Slamming against those rocks
When it lands
Will my eyes
Be closed or open? I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you I go through all this
Before you wake up
So I can feel happier
To be safe up here with you Safe up (here with you) I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
So special
But it hasn't happened yet
You are gorgeous
But I haven't met you yet
I remember
But it hasn't happened yet And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you I was peaking
But it hasn't happened yet
I haven't been given
My best souvenir
I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
I know your habits
But wouldn't recognize you yet And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you? I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting I miss you This wasn't supposed to happen,
I was happy by myself.
Accidentally, you seduced me,
I'm in love again. I lie in my bed
Totally still
My eyes wide open
I'm in rapture
I don't believe this
I'm in love again! This wasn't
Supposed to happen,
I've been hit
With your charm.
How could you do this
To me?
I'm in love
Again... I lie in my bed,
Totally still,
My eyes wide open.
I'm in rapture.
I don't believe this,
I'm in love again... This wasn't supposed to happen!
This wasn't supposed to happen! Yet i'm, yet I'm the same
Yet I'm definitive
Yet i'm, yet I'm the same
Yet I'm definitive A small story which never happened
I said ouch! this really hurts...
That can't be this has been
Practised for millions of years
Therefore we are
Yes, but i, I'm a boy. A small story which always happens
I said ouch! this really hurts...
This could well be
But this has
Been practised for millions of years,
Therefore we are
Yes, but, you're a girl! I lie in my bed,
Totally still,
My eyes wide open.
I'm in rapture.
I don't believe this,
I'm in love
Again... This wasn't supposed to happen. I lie in my bed,
Totally still,
My eyes wide open.
I'm in rapture.
(rapture)
You've put a seed inside me,
(oh)
And while you're away,
(see...)
It's growing silently,
(to be a life)
Starts in my stomach.
Embraces my insides,
(in time..)
And about to reach my heart. This wasn't supposed to happen!
This wasn't supposed to happen! Yet i'm, yet I'm the same
Yet I'm definitive
Yet I'm ? ? ? ? ? ?
Yet I'm ? ? ? ? ? ? Underneath our feet
Crystals grow like plants (listen how they grow)
I'm blinded by the lights (listen how they glow)
In the core of the earth (listen how they grow) Crystalline internal nebula (crystalline)
Rocks growing slow mo (crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia (crystalline)
And demand the lights We mimic the openness
Of the ones we love
Dove tail our generosity
Equalize the flow
With our hearts
We chisel quartz
To reach love Crystalline internal nebula (crystalline)
Rocks growing slow mo (crystalline)
I conquer claustrophobia (crystalline)
And demand the lights Octagon, polygon
Pipes up an organ
Sonic branches
Murmuring drone
Crystallizing galaxies
Spread out like my fingers (Crystalline) internal nebula
(Crystalline) rocks growing slow mo
(Crystalline) I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline) and demand the lights (Crystalline) internal nebula
(Crystalline) rocks growing slow mo
(Crystalline) I conquer claustrophobia
(Crystalline) and demand the lights It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety
It's the sparkle you become
When you conquer anxiety I live by the ocean
And during the night
I dive into it
Down to the bottom
Underneath all currents
And drop my anchor
As this is where I'm staying
This is my home I live by the ocean
And during the night
I dive into it
Down to the bottom
Underneath all currents
And drop my anchor
As this is where I'm staying
This is my home Through the warmest cord of care
Your love was sent to me
I'm not sure what to do with it
Or where to put it I'm so close to tears
And so close to
Simply calling you up
I'm simply suggesting We go to the hidden place
That we go to the hidden place
We go to the hidden place
We go to a hidden place Now I have been slightly shy
And I can smell a pinch of hope
To almost have allowed
Once fingers to stroke
The fingers I was given
To touch with but careful, careful There lies my passion, hidden
There lies my love
I'll hide it under a blanket
Lull it to sleep I'll keep it in a hidden place
I'll keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place
Keep it in a hidden place He's the beautifulest
Fragilest still strong
Dark and divine
And the littleness of his movements Hides himself
Invents a charm
That makes him invisible
Hides in the air Can I hide there too
Hide in the air of him
Seek solace
Sanctuary In the hidden place
In a hidden place
In a hidden place
We'll stay in a hidden place Oh, in a hidden place
We'll live in a hidden place
We'll be in a hidden place
In a hidden place I am leaving this harbor
Giving urban a farewell
Its habitants seem too keen on god
I cannot stomach their rights and wrongs I have lost my origin
And I don't want to find it again
Whether sailing into nature's laws
And be held by ocean's paws Wanderlust, relentlessly craving
Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more Lust for comfort
Suffocates the soul
Relentless restlessness
Liberates me (sets me free) I feel at home Whenever the unknown surrounds me
I receive its embrace
Aboard my floating house Wanderlust, relentlessly craving
Wanderlust, peel off the layers
Until we get to the core Did I imagine it would be like this
Was it something like this I wished for
Or will I want more Wanderlust, from island to island
Wanderlust, united in movement
Wonderful, I'm joined with you Wanderlust, wanderland Can you spot a pattern (Relentlessly restless) Can you spot a pattern
Can you I can sense it
Something important
Is about to happen
It's coming up It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle Big time sensuality
We just met
And I know I'm a bit too intimate
But something huge is coming up
And we're both included It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle Big time sensuality
I don't know my future after this weekend
And I don't want to! It takes courage to enjoy it
The hardcore and the gentle Big time sensuality In a forest pitch dark
Glowed the tiniest spark
It burst into flame
Like me
Like me My name Isobel
Married to myself
My love Isobel
Living by herself In a heart full of dust
Lives a creature called lust
It surprises and scares

Your nimble feet make prints in my sands
You have done good for yourselves
Since you left my wet embrace and crawled ashore Every boy, is a snake is a lily
Every pearl is a lynx, is a girl
Sweet like harmony made into flesh You dance by my side
Children sublime You show me continents
I see the islands
You count the centuries, I blink my eyes
Hawks and sparrows race in my waters
Stingrays are floating across the sky
Little ones, my sons and my daughters Your sweat is salty
I am why
I am why

Muddy with twigs and branches Turmoil, carnage Here come the earth intruders
We are the paratroopers
Stampede of sharpshooters
Come straight from voodoo With our feet thumping
With our feet marching
Grinding skeptics into the soil Shower of goodness
Coming to end the doubt pouring over
Shower of goodness coming to end We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo I have guided my bones
Through some voltage
And loved them still
And loved them too Metallic carnage
Ferocity
Feel the speed We are the earth intruders
We are the sharp shooters
Flock of parashooters
Necessary voodoo There is turmoil out there
Carnage, rambling What is to do but dig
Dig bones out of earth
Mudgraves, timber
Morbid trenches Here come the earth intruders
Stampede of resistance
We are the canoneers
Necessary voodoo And the beast
With many heads
And arms rolling
Steamroller We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches Forgive this tribe We are the earth intruders
We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
We are the earth intruders We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching We are the earth intruders
Muddy with twigs and branches
Marching March
March
March Stirring at water's edge
Cold froth on my twig
My mind in whirls
Wanders around desire May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often now craving miracles
Craving miracles No one imagines
The light shock I need
And I'll never know
From whose hands deeply humbled
Dangerous gift
As such to mine come May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craving miracles My romantic gene is dominant
And it hungers for union
Universal intimacy
All embracing May I, should I, or have I too often craving miracles
May I, can I, or have I too often craving miracles
Craved Waves irregularly striking
Wind stern in my face
Thunderstorm come
Scrape those barnacles
Off me May I, may I or should I too often now crave miracles
May I or should I or have I too often All my body parts are one
As lightning hits my spine
Sparkling
Prime runs through me
Revive my wish
I am inviolable May I, can I or have I too often
May I, can I, should I or have I too often craving miracles I shuffle around
The tectonic plates in my chest
You know I gave it all
Trying to match our continents
To change seasonal shift
To form a mutual core As fast as your fingernail grows
The Atlantic ridge drifts
To counteract distance
You know I gave it all
Can you hear the effort
Of the magnetic strife
Shuffling of columns
To form a mutual core This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know that I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you
You hid the key to our continuity
I didn't know you had it in you
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know, you didn't know What you resist persists
Nuance makes heat
To counteract distance
I know you gave it all
Offered me harmony
If things were done your way
My Eurasian plate subsumed
Forming a mutual core This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
Withheld your love, an unspent capsule
I didn't know you had it in you This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know I had it in me
This eruption undoes stagnation
You didn't know, you didn't know Darling stop confusing me
With your wishful thinking
Hopeful embraces
Don't you understand?
I have to go through this
I belong to here where
No-one cares and no-one loves
No light no air to live in
A place called hate
The city of fear I play dead
It stops the hurting
I play dead
And hurting stops It's sometimes just like sleeping
Curling up inside my private tortures
I nestle into pain
Hug suffering
Caress every ache I play dead
It stops the hurting You can have me
But I'll defend my child
By spring that child will die Oh deli owowow
Woo Moon, moon, moon I'm just so warm, Jennifer
and I'm coming over
to sabotage our distance Moon will leave me on
Moon will guide me through, baby
Moon will guide me through
Moon will turn me on I just don't care anymore
'Cause my chord is calling
It's me and truth
It's home
I'm at home with truth alone Moon will leave me on
Moon will guide us through
Moon will guide us through, baby
Moon will turn me on The moon
It guides me on baby
There's absolutely no doubt Me and truth
It's home
I'm at home with truth alone Not 'til you halo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers 'round your skull
I'll be yours I weave for you
The marvellous web
Glow in the dark threads
All neon like The cocoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you
Henh-yeah, henh-yeah The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish
Your turtleheart And they will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminous beam
It feeds you
Henh-yeah, yeah Don't get angry with yourself
Don't, don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you With a razorblade
I'll cut a slit open
And the luminous beam
Feeds you honey, heals you Don't get angry with yourself

Don't get angry with yourself
Don't get angry with yourself
I'll heal you
I'll heal you
Luminous
I'll heal you You think you're denying me of something
Well I've got plenty
You're the one who's missing out
But you won't notice 'Til after five years
If you'll live that long
You'll wake up
All loveless I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms I'm so bored with cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle You can't handle love
You can't handle love
You just can't handle I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms What's so scary
Not a threat in sight
You just can't handle
You can't handle love You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle I dare you
To take me on
I dare you
To show me your palms I'm so bored of cowards
That say they want
Then they can't handle You can't handle love, baby
You can't handle love
It's obvious
You can't handle I dare you, I dare you
I dare you, I dare you Like a virus needs a body
As soft tissue feeds on blood
Some day I'll find you, the urge is here Like a mushroom on a tree trunk
As the protein transmutates
I knock on your skin, and I am in The perfect match, you and me
I adapt, contagious
You open up, say welcome Like a flame that seeks explosives
As gunpowder needs a war
I feast inside you, my host is you The perfect match, you and I
You fail to resist
My crystalline charm Like a virus, patient hunter
I'm waiting for you, I'm starving for you My sweet adversary
My sweet adversary
My sweet adversary Get over the sorrow, girl
The world is always going to be made of this You can trust in it
Unless you breathe in
Bravely I, I
I adore how you simply surrender to high And your lungs
They're mourning
Teepee style All the still born love that could've happened
All the moments you should have embraced
All the moments you should have not locked up Understand
So clearly
To shut yourself up
Would be the hugest crime of them all
Hugest crime of them all
You're just crying after all
To not want them humans around
Anymore Get over that sorrow, girl
Get over I see
Who you are
Behind the skin
And the muscles I see
Who you are now
And when you'll get older later
I will
See the same girl
Seem so lioness fire heart, passionate lover And afterwards
Later this century
When you and I have become corpses Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
And enjoy every bit of you
Love me Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
Let me push you up against me tightly
Let's celebrate now
All this flesh on our bones
And enjoy every bit of you I see who you are
Let me see who you are One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all come true One day
When you're ready
One day, one day
When you're up to it The atmosphere
Will get lighter
And two suns ready
To shine just for you I can feel it
I can feel it One day
It will happen
One day, one day
It will all make sense One day
It will blossom
One day, one day
When you're ready An aeroplane
Will curve gracefully
Around the volcano
With the eruption
That never lets you down I can feel it
I can feel it And the beautifulness
Fireworks will burn in
In the sky
Oh just for you I can feel it
I can feel it One day
One day
One day
One day As the lukewarm hands of the Gods
Came down and gently picked my adrenaline pearls
They placed them in their mouths
And rinsed all of the fear out
Nourished them with their saliva Oh rested, as if the healthiest past time
Is being in life threatening circumstances
And once again be reborn (All birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy
(All birthed and happy)
All birthed and happy
(All birthed and happy) Best way to start the new is to fail miserably
Fail at loving and fail at giving
Fail at creating a flow then realign the whole
And kick into the start hole And kick into the start hole
And kick into the start hole To risk all is the end all and the beginning all
To risk all is the end all and the beginning all I've seen it all
I have seen the trees
I have seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all there is no more to see You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru I'm happy to say I had better to do What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall? All walls are great if the roof doesn't fall
The man you will marry, the home you will share To be honest, I really don't care You've never been to Niagara Falls? I have seen water
It's water, that's all The Eiffel Tower
And the Empire State What else was a sigh
and what ails the state Your grandson's hand
As he plays with your hair To be honest, I really don't care I've seen it all
I've seen the dark
I've seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough
To want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all there is no more to see You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark the big and the small
Just keep in mind you need no more at all You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You've seen it all there is no more to see Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favourite things Cream coloured ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleighbells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favourite things Girls in white Dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver White winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favourite things When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling bad
I simply remember my favourite things
And then I don't feel so sad Come on girl
Let's sneak out of this party
It's getting boring
There's more to life than this It's still early morning
We could go down to the harbor
And jump between the boats
And see the sun come up We could nick a boat
And sneak off to this island
I could bring my little ghetto blaster
There's more to life than this But then we'd have to rush back
To the town's best baker
To get the first bread of the morning
There's more to life than this There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this Black night is fallen
The sun has gone to bed
The innocent are dreaming
As you should sleepyhead
Sleepyhead
Sleepyhead
All the love above
I send into you
Comfort and protection (I'll watch over you)
But don't ask me what's gonna happen next

Undo if you're bleeding
Undo if you're sweating
Undo if you're crying Undo
Undo Train-whistles, a sweet clementine
Blueberries, dancers in line
Cobwebs, a bakery sign Ooooh - a sweet clementine
Ooooh - dancers in line
Ooooh ... If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder - I wonder
What happens next?
A new world, a new day to see I'm softly walking on air
Halfway to heaven from here
Sunlight unfolds in my hair Ooooh - I'm walking on air
Ooooh - to heaven from here
Ooooh ... If living is seeing
I'm holding my breath
In wonder - I wonder
What happens next?
A new world, a new day to see A divorced lady arrives home from a bar,
Guess, guess what she see, sees there.
There's a naked person in my flat!
He's got a weird expression on his face!
Oh my god and jesus as well,
What are you doing here?
Are you hurting your chest,
Offending yourself,
Forcing yourself into pain like there is no tommorow?
You should use the pain and sorrow
To fill you up with power,
Life's both sweet and sour. He looks at me hopeless with tears in his eyes,
Goes out of the window and up on the roof.
Naked man, naked man, come down.
I.. I'll.. I'll give you some strawberry cake!
Don't act like there's no tomorrow,
You should use the pain and sorrow
To fill you up with power,
life's bothsweet and sour. tak'i takt & trega. ja! I will wade out
Till my thighs
Are steeped
In burning flowers I will take the sun
In my mouth
And leap into
The ripe air
Alive with closed eyes To dash
Against darkness In the sleeping curves
Of my body I shall enter
Fingers
Of smooth mastery With chasteness
Of sea-girls
Will I complete
The mystery
Of my flesh
Will I
Complete
The mystery
Of my flesh
My flesh I wake up
And the day feels broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle 'Cause the evening
I've always longed for
It could still happen How do I master
The perfect day
Six glasses of water
Seven phone calls If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you If you wake up
And the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Notice
How it sparkles
Down there I can decide what I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given Unthinkable surprises
About to happen
But what they are It's not up to you
Well, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
Oh, it never really was
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you There is too much
Clinging
To peak
There is too much
Pressure I have a recurrent dream
Every time I lose my voice
I swallow little glowing lights
My mother and son baked for me During the night
They do a trapeze walk
Until they're in the sky
Right above my bed While I'm asleep
My mother and son pour into me
Warm glowing oil
Into my wide open throat I have a recurrent dream
Every time I feel a hoarseness
I swallow warm glowing lights
My mother and son baked for me They make me feel so much better
They make me feel better We have a recurrent dream
Every time we lose our voices
We dream we swallow little lights
Our mother and sons bake for us During the night
They do a little trapeze walk
Until they're in the sky
(Right above our heads)
Right above our heads While we're asleep
My mother and son pour into us
Warm glowing oil
Into our wide open throats I have a recurrent dream They make me feel better
They make me feel better Now you say you love me
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you You drove me, nearly drove me
Out of my head when you never shed a tear Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was through with being
Told me you were through with me but Now you say you love me
And just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you You drove me, nearly drove me
Out of my head when you never shed a tear Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was through with being
Told me you were through with me but Now you say you love me
And just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you Look no further
Look no further
Look no further Cruelest
Almost
Always to ourselves
It mustn't
Get any better

It always was
It's in our hands
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands
It's all there
In our hands Well,
Now aren't we scaring ourselves
Unnecessarily?
Aren't we trying too hard? 'Cause it's in our hands
It's in our hands
It's all here
It's in our hands Look no further
Look no further It's in our hands
It always was
It's in our hands
It's in our hands

So much on me I'm born, stubborn, me and will always be
Before you count one, two, three

Private branch of this tree You gardener, you discipliner
Domestically, I can obey
All of your rules
And still be, be I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
I never thought I would compromise
Let's unite, tonight
We wish you, shouldn't fight
Embrace, you tight, let's unite, tonight I thrive best, hermit style
With a beard, and a pipe
And a parrot on each side
But now I can't do this without you I never thought I would compromise

Embrace you tight
Let's unite tonight Let's unite, tonight
We wish you, shouldn't fight
Embrace, you tight, let's Unison
Unison
Unison Why can't you give her room
Respect her spatial needs
I feel you compress her
Into a small space With clairvoyance
She knew what you needed
And she gave it to you
Now her desires are repressed
Arrows smooth the flesh When she found your love
Her nature bowed her head
She surrendered
She renounced the world for you
Now she's poisoned by demands
You cannot answer Why this sacrifice
Now she regrets the whole thing
A delayed reaction
When she left her craft voluntarily
For your nest, for your love
Did you understand Appreciate
Build a bridge to her
Initiate a touch
Before it's too late
Say the words to her
That will make her shine
Tell her that you love her Your generosity will show
In volume of her glow
Your generosity will show
In volume of her glow
Your generosity will show
In volume of her glow I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
So special
But it hasn't happened yet
You are gorgeous
But I haven't met you yet
I remember
But it hasn't happened yet And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you I was peaking
But it hasn't happened yet
I haven't been given
My best souvenir
I miss you
But I haven't met you yet
I know your habits
But wouldn't recognize you yet And if you believe in dreams
Or what is more important
That a dream can come true
I will meet you I'm so impatient
I can't stand the wait
When will I get my cuddle?
Who are you? I know by now that you'll arrive
By the time I stop waiting I miss you Black night is falling
The sun is gone to bed
The innocent are dreaming
As you should sleepy head
Sleepy head, sleepy head Does it hurt? I hurt you much more
So don't you worry I don't know what to do
Everything just feels so wrong Everything is right
Just stay strong See selma, you're the one to blame You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do Time, it takes a tear to fall
A snake to shed it's skin
That's all the time is needed
To forgive You are forgiven
Come on, hurry I killed your bill You have to hurry up
I called the police
They're just down the road They've come for me
Why should I run? They'll take your money
Run for your boy See selma, you're the one to blame You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do
You just did what you had to do Time, it takes a tear to fall
A heart to miss a beat
A snake to shed it's skin
A rose to grow a thorn
Its all the time that's needed
To forgive me
I am so sorry
I just did what I had to do
I just did what I had to do
