THE QUEEN _of_ HEARTS


    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts,
      All on a summer's day;

    The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,
      And took them clean away.

    The King of Hearts called for those tarts,
    And beat the Knave full sore.

    The Knave of Hearts brought back those tarts,
      And vowed he'd steal no more.

      My bonnie laddie,
    Dance to your daddie, my bonnie lamb!

    You shall get a fishie when the boat comes hame!

      My bonnie laddie,
    Dance to your daddie, and to your mammie sing!

THE MAN IN THE MOON


    The man in the moon
    Came tumbling down
    And asked the way to Norwich;
    He went by the south,
    And burnt his mouth
    With eating cold pease porridge.




SIMPLE SIMON


    Simple Simon met a pie-man,
      Going to the fair;
    Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
      "Let me taste your ware."

    Says the pie-man unto Simon,
      "First give me a penny."
    Says Simple Simon to the pie-man,
      "I have not got any."

    He went to catch a dicky-bird,
      And thought he could not fail,
    Because he had got a little salt
      To put upon his tail.

    He went to ride a spotted cow,
      That had got a little calf,
    She threw him down upon the ground,
      Which made the people laugh.

    Then Simple Simon went a-hunting,
      For to catch a hare,
    He rode a goat about the street,
      But could not find one there.

    He went for to eat honey
      Out of the mustard-pot,
    He bit his tongue until he cried,
      That was all the good he got.

    Simple Simon went a-fishing
      For to catch a whale;
    And all the water he had got
      Was in his mother's pail.

    He went to take a bird's nest,
      Was built upon a bough;
    A branch gave way, and Simon fell
      Into a dirty slough.

    He went to shoot a wild duck,
      But the wild duck flew away;
    Says Simon, "I can't hit him,
      Because he will not stay."

    Once Simon made a great Snowball,
      And brought it in to roast;
    He laid it down before the fire,
      And soon the ball was lost.

    He went to slide upon the ice,
      Before the ice would bear;
    Then he plunged in above his knees,
      Which made poor Simon stare.

    He went to try if cherries ripe
      Grew upon a thistle;
    He pricked his finger very much,
      Which made poor Simon whistle.

    He washed himself with blacking-ball,
      Because he had no soap:
    Then, then, said to his mother,
      "I'm a beauty now, I hope."

    He went for water in a sieve,
      But soon it all ran through;
    And now poor Simple Simon
      Bids you all adieu.




TOAD AND FROG


    "Croak," said the toad, "I'm hungry I think,
    To-day I've had nothing to eat or to drink;
    I'll crawl to a garden and jump through the pales,
    And there I'll dine nicely on slugs and on snails."

    "Ho, ho!" quoth the frog, "is that what you mean?
    Then I'll hop away to the next meadow stream,
    There I will drink, and eat worms and slugs too,
    And then I shall have a good dinner like you."




LITTLE JACK HORNER


      Little Jack Horner
      Sat in a corner
    Eating of Christmas pie;

      He put in his thumb,
      And pulled out a plum,
    And cried "What a good boy was I!"




THE WOOING


        There was a little man,
        Who wooed a little maid;
    And he said: "Little maid, will you wed, wed, wed?
        I have little more to say,
        So will you ay or nay
    For the least said is soonest mend-ed, ded, ded."

        Then the little maid replied:
        "Should I be your little bride,
    Pray what must we have for to eat, eat, eat?
        Will the flame that you're so rich in
        Light a fire in the kitchen?
    Or the little god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit?"




HANDY PANDY


    Handy Pandy, Jack-a-Dandy,
      Loves plum-cake and sugar-candy;
    He bought some at a grocer's shop,
      And out he came, hop, hop, hop.




THE KILKENNY CATS


    There were once two cats of Kilkenny,
    Each thought there was one cat too many;
    So they fought and they fit,
    And they scratched and they bit,
    Till, excepting their nails
    And the tips of their tails,
    Instead of two cats, there weren't any.




BLOW WIND BLOW


    Blow, wind, blow! and go, mill, go!

    Catches up three legs,
    Throws it after four legs,

BLUE BELL BOY


    I had a little boy,
      And called him Blue Bell;
    Gave him a little work,
      He did it very well.

    I bade him go upstairs
      To bring me a gold pin;
    In coal-scuttle fell he,
      Up to his little chin.

    He went to the garden
      To pick a little sage;
    He tumbled on his nose,
      And fell into a rage.

    He went to the cellar
      To draw a little beer;
    And quickly did return
      To say there was none there.

JOHN COOK'S GREY MARE


    John Cook had a little grey mare; he, haw, hum!
    Her back stood up, and her bones they were bare; he, haw, hum!

    John Cook was riding up Shuter's bank; he, haw, hum!
    And there his nag did kick and prank; he, haw, hum!

    John Cook was riding up Shuter's hill; he, haw, hum!
    His mare fell down, and she made her will; he, haw, hum!

    The bridle and saddle were laid on the shelf; he, haw, hum!
    If you want any more you may sing it yourself; he, haw, hum!

      And ho! my kitten, my deary!
    Such a sweet pet as this
      Was neither far nor neary.

      Here we go down, down, down;
    Here we go backwards and forwards,

    And you and I will keep ourselves warm.




THE QUARRELSOME KITTENS


    Two little kittens one stormy night,
    They began to quarrel and they began to fight;
    One had a mouse and the other had none,
    And that's the way the quarrel begun.

    "I'll have that mouse," said the biggest cat.
    "You'll have that mouse? we'll see about that!"
    "I will have that mouse," said the eldest son.
    "You sha'n't have the mouse," said the little one.

    I told you before 't was a stormy night
    When these two little kittens began to fight;
    The old woman seized her sweeping broom,
    And swept the two kittens right out of the room.

    The ground was covered with frost and snow,
    And the two little kittens had nowhere to go;
    So they laid them down on the mat at the door,
    While the old woman finished sweeping the floor.

    Then they crept in, as quiet as mice,
    All wet with the snow, and as cold as ice,
    For they found it was better, that stormy night,
    To lie down and sleep than to quarrel and fight.




THE FLY AND THE HUMBLE-BEE

      Pray, how do you do?"

THE LITTLE CLOCK


    There's a neat little clock,
      In the schoolroom it stands,
    And it points to the time
      With its two little hands.
    And may we, like the clock,
      Keep a face clean and bright,
    With hands ever ready
     To do what is right.




LITTLE MAID

    "Old woman, old woman, old woman," quoth I,
    "Where are you going to up so high?"
    "To brush the cobwebs off the sky!"
    "May I go with thee?" "Aye, by-and-by."




POOR OLD ROBINSON CRUSOE


    Poor old Robinson Crusoe!
    Poor old Robinson Crusoe!

    And a ring a ting tang,
    Poor old Robinson Crusoe!




TWO LITTLE DOGS


    Two little dogs sat by the fire,
      Over a fender of coal-dust;

      Were fiddle, faddle, feedle.

    A sportsman chanced to come that way,
      Whiskey, whaskey, weedle;

      So fiddle, faddle, feedle!"

    Home again, home again,

THE LITTLE GUINEA-PIG


    There was a little Guinea-Pig,
    Who, being little, was not big;
    He always walked upon his feet,
    And never fasted when he eat.

    When from a place he ran away,
    He never at that place did stay;
    And while he ran, as I am told,
    He ne'er stood still for young or old.

    He often squeak'd and sometimes vi'lent,
    And when he squeak'd he ne'er was silent:
    Though ne'er instructed by a cat,
    He knew a mouse was not a rat.

    One day, as I am certified,
    He took a whim, and fairly died;
    And, as I'm told by men of sense,
    He never has been living since.

HUSH-A-BYE BABY


    Hush-a-bye, baby,
      On the tree top,
    When the wind blows,
      The cradle will rock;

    When the bough breaks,
      The cradle will fall,
    Down tumbles baby,
      Cradle, and all.




IN MARBLE HALLS


    In marble halls as white as milk,
    Lined with a skin as soft as silk;

    Within a fountain crystal clear,
    A golden apple doth appear;

    No doors there are to this stronghold,
    Yet thieves break in and steal the gold.




JACK SPRAT'S PIG


    Jack Sprat had a pig, who was not very little,
      Nor yet very big;

    Says little Jack Sprat.

                                     all wished a piece of it




THE PUMPKIN EATER


    Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater,
    Had a wife and couldn't keep her;
    He put her in a pumpkin shell,
    And there he kept her very well.




HUSH-A-BYE, BABY


    Hush-a-bye, baby,
      Daddy is near;
    Mamma is a lady,
      And that's very clear.




BIRDS OF A FEATHER


    Birds of a feather flock together,
        And so will pigs and swine;
    Rats and mice will have their choice,
        And so will I have mine.




COCK-A-DOODLE-DO


    Oh, my pretty cock! Oh, my handsome cock!
      I pray you, do not crow before day,
    And your comb shall be made of the very beaten gold,
      And your wings of the silver so gray.




HUSH, BABY, MY DOLLY


    Hush, baby, my dolly, I pray you don't cry,
    And I'll give you some bread and some milk by and by;
    Or perhaps you like custard, or maybe a tart,
    Then to either you're welcome, with all my heart.




I HAD A LITTLE PONY


    I had a little pony
    His name was Dapple-Grey,
    I lent him to a lady,
    To ride a mile away.
    She whipped him, she lashed him,
    She rode him through the mire;
    I would not lend my pony now
    For all the lady's hire.




SNAIL


    Snail, snail, come out of your hole,
    Or else I'll beat you as black as a coal.
    Snail, snail, put out your horns,
    Here comes a thief to pull down your walls.




MY LADY WIND


    My lady Wind, my lady Wind,
    Went round about the house to find
      A chink to get her foot in:
    She tried the keyhole in the door,
    She tried the crevice in the floor,
      And drove the chimney soot in.

    And then one night, when it was dark,
    She blew up such a tiny spark,
      That all the house was pothered:
    From it she raised up such a flame,
    As flamed away to Belting Lane,
      And White Cross folks were smothered.

    And thus when once, my little dears,
    A whisper reaches itching ears,
      The same will come, you'll find:
    Take my advice, restrain the tongue,
    Remember what old nurse has sung
      Of busy lady Wind!




LITTLE JENNY WREN


    As little Jenny Wren
      Was sitting by the shed,
    She waggled with her tail,
      And nodded with her head.

    She waggled with her tail,
      And nodded with her head,
    As little Jenny Wren
      Was sitting by the shed.




POOR ROBIN


      The north wind doth blow,
      And we shall have snow,
    And what will poor Robin do then?
        Poor thing!

      He'll sit in a barn,
      And to keep himself warm
    Will hide his head under his wing.
        Poor thing!




PUSSY CAT


    Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, where have you been?
    I've been up to London to look at the queen.

    Pussy-cat, pussy-cat, what did you there?
    I frightened a little mouse under the chair.




DANCE, LITTLE BABY


    Dance, little Baby, dance up high,
    Never mind, Baby, Mother is by;
    Crow and caper, caper and crow,
    There, little Baby, there you go;
    Up to the ceiling, down to the ground,
    Backwards and forwards, round and round;
    Dance, little Baby, and Mother will sing,
    With the merry coral, ding, ding, ding!




OF WASHING


    They that wash on Friday, wash in need;
    And they that wash on Saturday, oh! they're sluts indeed.




DICKERY, DICKERY, DARE


    Dickery, dickery, dare,
    The pig flew up in the air;
    The man in brown soon brought him down,
    Dickery, dickery, dare.

A FROG HE WOULD AWOOING GO


    A frog he would a-wooing go,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    Whether his mother would let him or no.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.


    So off he set with his opera hat,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    And on the road he met with a rat.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Pray, Mr. Rat, will you go with me?"
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    "Kind Mistress Mousey for to see!"
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    When they reached the door of Mousey's hall,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    They gave a loud knock, and they gave a loud call.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Pray, Mistress Mouse, are you within?"
        Heigho! says Rowley;
    "Oh, yes, kind sirs, I'm sitting to spin."
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Pray, Mistress Mouse, will you give us some beer?"
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    "For Froggy and I are fond of good cheer."
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Pray, Mr. Frog, will you give us a song?"
        Heigho! says Rowley;
    "But let it be something that's not very long."
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Indeed, Mistress Mouse," replied Mr. Frog,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    "A cold has made me as hoarse as a hog."
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    "Since you have caught cold, Mr. Frog," Mousey said,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    "I'll sing you a song that I have just made."
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    But while they were all a merry-making,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    A cat with her kittens came tumbling in.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    The cat she seized the rat by the crown,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    The kittens they pulled the little mouse down.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    This put Mr. Frog in a terrible fright,
        Heigho! says Rowley;
    He took up his hat and he wished them good-night.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    But as Froggy was crossing over a brook,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    A lily-white duck came and gobbled him up.
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.

    So there was an end of one, two, and three,
        Heigho! says Rowley,
    The Rat, the Mouse, and the little Frog-gee!
      With a rowley powley, gammon and spinach,
      Heigho! says Anthony Rowley.




THE MOUSE AND THE MILLER


    There was an old woman
    Lived under a hill,
    She put a mouse in a bag,

    By the point of his knife,
    He never took toll
    Of a mouse in his life!

OF THE CUTTING OF NAILS

    Cut them on Friday, you cut them for sorrow;
    Cut them on Saturday, you'll see your true-love to-morrow;
    Cut them on Sunday, and you will have ill fortune all through the week.




THE ORANGE STEALER

      And I took two pence home to my wife.

    It blows the bait in the fish's mouth;
    When the wind is in the West,
    Then 'tis at the very best.




A WARNING

      The robin and the wren;

      And wealthy and wise.




MY MAID MARY

A MEDLEY


    On Christmas Eve I turned the spit,
    I burnt my fingers, I feel it yet;
    The cock sparrow flew over the table,
    The pot began to play with the ladle;
    The ladle stood up like a naked man,
    And vowed he'd fight the frying-pan;
    The frying-pan behind the door
    Said he never saw the like before;
    And the kitchen clock I was going to wind
    Said he never saw the like behind.

    By selling codlins, hot, hot, hot!

    A Long-Tailed pig and a short-tailed pig,
    Or a pig without e'er a tail,
    A sow pig, or a boar pig,
    Or a pig with a curly tail.




GOOD KING ARTHUR


    When good King Arthur ruled this land
      He was a goodly king;
    He stole three pecks of barley-meal
      To make a bag-pudding.

    A bag-pudding the king did make,
      And stuff'd it well with plums;
    And in it put great lumps of fat,
      As big as my two thumbs.

    The king and queen did eat thereof,
      And noble men beside;
    And what they could not eat that night,
      The queen next morning fried.

    This is the end
    Of Solomon Grundy.




THREE BLIND MICE


    Three blind mice, three blind mice,

    As three blind mice?

TWINKLE, TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR


    Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
    Up above the world so high,
    Like a diamond in the sky.

    When the blazing sun is gone,
    When he nothing shines upon,
    Then you show your little light,
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

    Then the traveller in the dark
    Thanks you for your tiny spark:
    How could he see where to go,
    If you did not twinkle so?

    In the dark blue sky you keep,
    Often through my curtains peep,
    For you never shut your eye
    Till the sun is in the sky.

    How your bright and tiny spark
    Lights the traveller in the dark!
    Though I know not what you are,
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star.




BOYS _and_ GIRLS


    Boys and girls come out to play,
    The moon doth shine as bright as day;

    Come with a whoop, and come with a call,
    Come with a good will or come not at all.

    Lose your supper and lose your sleep,
    Come to your playfellows in the street.

    Up the ladder and down the wall,
    A halfpenny loaf will serve us all;

    You find milk, and I'll find flour,
    And we'll have a pudding in half an hour.




SING IVY


    My father he left me three acres of land,
      Sing ivy, sing ivy;
    My father he left me three acres of land,
      Sing holly, go whistle, and ivy!

    I ploughed it with a ram's horn,
      Sing ivy, sing ivy;
    And sowed it all over with one peppercorn,
      Sing holly, go whistle, and ivy!

    I harrowed it with a bramble bush,
      Sing ivy, sing ivy;
    And reaped it with my little pen-knife,
      Sing holly, go whistle, and ivy!




PUSSYCAT MEW

GOOSEY, GOOSEY, GANDER


    Goosey, goosey, gander,
      Whither dost thou wander?
    Up stairs and down stairs,
      And in my lady's chamber.

    There I met an old man
      That would not say his prayers;
    I took him by the left leg,
      And threw him down stairs.




THE MAN AND HIS CALF


    There was an old man,

SEEKING A WIFE


    When I was a bachelor, I lived by myself,
    And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon a shelf,
    The rats and the mice did lead me such a life,
    That I went up to London, to get myself a wife.

    The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow,
    I could not get my wife home without a wheelbarrow,
    The wheelbarrow broke, my wife got a fall,
    Down tumbled wheelbarrow, little wife, and all.




DOCTOR FAUSTUS


    Doctor Faustus was a good man,
      He whipped his scholars now and then;

      And then he whipped them back again.

OVER THE WATER TO CHARLEY


    Over the water, and over the lea,
    And over the water to Charley.

    Over the water, and over the sea,
    And over the water to Charley,

    To make a white cake for my Charley.




THREE JOLLY WELSHMEN


    There were three jolly Welshmen,
      As I have heard say,
    And they went a-hunting
      Upon St. David's day.

    All the day they hunted,
      And nothing could they find;
    But a ship a-sailing,
      A-sailing with the wind.

    One said it was a ship,
      The other he said "Nay";
    The third he said it was a house,
      With the chimney blown away.

    And all the night they hunted,
      And nothing could they find,
    But the moon a-gliding,
      A-gliding with the wind.

    One said it was the moon,
      The other he said "Nay";
    The third he said it was a cheese,
      With half o' it cut away.

    Thrice so merrily hopped she,
    Heigh O, heigh O, heigh O!




THE GIRL IN THE LANE


      The girl in the lane, that couldn't speak plain,

A SWARM OF BEES


    A swarm of bees in May
    Is worth a load of hay;
    A swarm of bees in June
    Is worth a silver spoon;
    A swarm of bees in July
    Is not worth a fly.


ROBIN AND RICHARD


    Robin and Richard were two little men,
    They did not awake till the clock struck ten;

    Then up starts Robin, and looks at the sky;
    Oh! brother Richard, the sun's very high!

    They both were ashamed, on such a fine day,

    Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,
      And can't tell where to find them;
    Let them alone, and they'll come home,
      And bring their tails behind them.

    Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,
      And dreamt she heard them bleating;
    And when she awoke, she found it a joke,
      For still they were all fleeting.

    Then up she took her little crook,
      Determined for to find them;
    She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,
      For they'd left all their tails behind them.

    It happened one day as Bo-Peep did stray
      Into a meadow hard by,
    There she espied their tails side by side,
      All hung on a tree to dry.

    She heaved a sigh, and wiped her eye,
      And went over hill and dale, oh;
    And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,
      To tack to each sheep its tail, oh!

THE OBSTINATE PIG


An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked
sixpence.

"What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go to
market, and buy a little pig."

As she was coming home she came to a stile; but Piggy would not go
over the stile.

She went a little farther and she met a dog.

      So she said to the dog:

    "Dog, dog, bite pig!
    Piggy won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the dog would not.

She went a little farther and she met a stick.

    "Stick, stick, beat dog!
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the stick would not.

She went a little farther and she met a fire.

      So she said:

    "Fire, fire, burn stick!
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the fire would not.

She went a little farther and she met some water.

      So she said:

    "Water, water, quench fire!
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the water would not.

She went a little farther and she met an ox.

      So she said:

    "Ox, ox, drink water!
    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the ox would not.

She went a little farther and she met a butcher.

      So she said:

    "Butcher, butcher, kill ox!
    Ox won't drink water;
    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the butcher would not.

She went a little farther and she met a rope.

      So she said:

    "Rope, rope, hang butcher!
    Butcher won't kill ox;
    Ox won't drink water;
    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the rope would not.

She went a little farther and she met a rat.

      So she said:

    "Rat, rat, gnaw rope!
    Rope won't hang butcher;
    Butcher won't kill ox;
    Ox won't drink water;
    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

    But the rat would not.

She went a little farther and she met a cat.

      So she said:

    "Cat, cat, kill rat!
    Rat won't gnaw rope;
    Rope won't hang butcher;
    Butcher won't kill ox;
    Ox won't drink water;
    Water won't quench fire;
    Fire won't burn stick;
    Stick won't beat dog;
    Dog won't bite pig;
    Pig won't get over the stile;
    And I sha'n't get home to-night."

The cat said: "If you will get me a saucer of milk from the cow in
yonder field I will kill the rat."

So the old woman went to the cow and said: "Cow, cow, will you give me
a saucer of milk?" And the cow said: "If you will get me a bucket full
of water from yonder brook I will give you the milk." And the old
woman took the bucket to the brook; but the water all rushed out
through the holes in the bottom. So she filled the holes up with
stones, got the water, and took it to the cow, who at once gave her
the saucer of milk. Then the old woman gave the cat the milk, and when
she had lapped up the milk--

    The cat began to kill the rat;
    The rat began to gnaw the rope;
    The rope began to hang the butcher;
    The butcher began to kill the ox;
    The ox began to drink the water;
    The water began to quench the fire;
    The fire began to burn the stick;
    The stick began to beat the dog;
    The dog began to bite the pig;
    The pig jumped over the stile;
    And so the old woman got home that night.




BOW-WOW, SAYS THE DOG


    Bow-wow, says the dog;
    Mew-mew, says the cat;
    Grunt, grunt, goes the hog;
    And squeak, goes the rat.

    Chirp, chirp, says the sparrow;
    Caw, caw, says the crow;
    Quack, quack, says the duck;
    And what cuckoos say, you know.

    So, with sparrows and cuckoos,
    With rats and with dogs,
    With ducks and with crows,
    With cats and with hogs,

    A fine song I have made,
    To please you, my dear;
    And if it's well sung,
    'T will be charming to hear.

TOMMY'S CAKE

    And mark it with T,
    And there will be enough
    For Jacky and me.




THE MAN OF THESSALY


    There was a man of Thessaly,
      And he was wond'rous wise,
    He jump'd into a quickset hedge,
      And scratched out both his eyes:

    But when he saw his eyes were out,
      With all his might and main
    He jump'd into another hedge,
      And scratch'd them back again.




CUSHY COW


    Cushy cow, bonny, let down thy milk,
    And I will give thee a gown of silk;
    A gown of silk and a silver tee,
    If thou wilt let down thy milk to me.




THERE WAS AN OLD WOMAN


    There was an old woman, and what do you think?
    She lived upon nothing but victuals and drink;
    And tho' victuals and drink were the chief of her diet,
    This plaguy old woman could never keep quiet.
    She went to the baker to buy her some bread,
    And when she came home her old husband was dead;
    She went to the clerk to toll the bell,
    And when she came back her old husband was well.

SING A SONG OF SIXPENCE


    Sing a song of sixpence,
      Pockets full of rye;
    Four and twenty blackbirds
      Baked in a pie.

    When the pie was opened
      The birds began to sing;
    Was not that a dainty dish
      To set before the king?

    The king was in his counting-house
      Counting out his money;
    The queen was in the parlour,
      Eating bread and honey;

    The maid was in the garden
      Hanging out the clothes,
    Down came a blackbird,
      And snapped off her nose.




THREE CHILDREN SLIDING


    Three children sliding on the ice
      Upon a summer's day,
    As it fell out, they all fell in,
      The rest they ran away.

    O! had these children been at school,
      Or sliding on dry ground,
    Ten thousand pounds to one penny
      They had not then been drown'd.

    Ye parents who have children dear,
        And eke ye that have none,
    If you would have them safe abroad,
        Pray keep them safe at home.




RIDE AWAY, RIDE AWAY

    And he shall have pussy-cat tied to one side;
    And he shall have little dog tied to the other;
    And Johnny shall ride to see his grandmother.




MOTHER GOOSE


    Old Mother Goose, when
      She wanted to wander,
    Would ride through the air
      On a very fine gander.

    Mother Goose had a house,
      'T was built in a wood,
    Where an owl at the door
      For sentinel stood.

    She had a son Jack,
      A plain-looking lad,
    He was not very good,
      Nor yet very bad.

    She sent him to market,
      A live goose he bought;
    "Here, Mother," says he,
      "It will not go for nought."

    Jack's goose and her gander
      Grew very fond;
    They'd both eat together,
      Or swim in one pond.

    Jack found one morning,
      As I have been told,
    His goose had laid him
      An egg of pure gold.

    Jack ran to his mother,
      The news for to tell,
    She called him a good boy,
      And said it was well.

    Jack sold his gold egg
      To a rogue of a Jew,
    Who cheated him out of
      The half of his due.

    Then Jack went a-courting
      A lady so gay,
    As fair as the lily,
      As sweet as the May.

    The Jew and the Squire
      Came behind his back,
    And began to belabour
      The sides of poor Jack.

    Then old Mother Goose
      That instant came in,
    And turned her son Jack
      Into famed Harlequin.

    She then with her wand
      Touched the lady so fine,
    And turned her at once
      Into sweet Columbine.

    The gold egg into
      The sea was thrown then,--
    When Jack jumped in,
      And got the egg back again.

    The Jew got the goose,
      Which he vowed he would kill,
    Resolving at once
      His pockets to fill.

    Jack's mother came in,
      And caught the goose soon,
    And mounting its back,
      Flew up to the moon.




DEAR, DEAR!


    Dear, dear! what can the matter be?
    Two old women got up in an apple-tree;
    One came down,
    And the other stayed till Satur-day.




THE LION AND THE UNICORN


    The lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown;
    The lion beat the unicorn all round about the town.
    Some gave them white bread, and some gave them brown;
    Some gave them plum-cake, and sent them out of town.




THE LITTLE MOUSE


    I have seen you, little mouse,
    Running all about the house,
    Through the hole, your little eye
    In the wainscot peeping sly,
    Hoping soon some crumbs to steal,
    To make quite a hearty meal.
    Look before you venture out,
    See if pussy is about,
    If she's gone, you'll quickly run
    To the larder for some fun,
    Round about the dishes creep,
    Taking into each a peep,
    To choose the daintiest that's there,
    Spoiling things you do not care.




THE NUT-TREE


    I had a little nut-tree, nothing would it bear
    But a silver nutmeg and a golden pear;
    The King of Spain's daughter came to see me,
    And all was because of my little nut-tree.
    I skipped over water, I danced over sea,
    And all the birds in the air couldn't catch me.




POLLY FLINDERS


    Little Polly Flinders
    Sat among the cinders,
      Warming her ten little toes!

      For spoiling her nice new clothes.




BRIAN O'LIN


    Brian O'Lin had no breeches to wear,
    So he bought him a sheep-skin and made him a pair,
    With the skinny side out, and the woolly side in,
    "Ah, ha, that is warm!" said Brian O'Lin.

    Brian O'Lin and his wife and wife's mother,
    They all went over a bridge together;
    The bridge was broken and they all fell in,
    "Mischief take all!" quoth Brian O'Lin.




MARGERY DAW


    See-saw, Margery Daw,
    Jacky shall have a new master.
    He shall have but a penny a day,

NONSENSE


    We are all in the dumps,
    For diamonds are trumps,
      The kittens are gone to St. Paul's,
    The babies are bit,
    The moon's in a fit,
      And the houses are built without walls.




ANOTHER FALLING OUT


    My little old man and I fell out;
    I'll tell you what 't was all about:

    And that's the way the noise begun.




LITTLE BOY BLUE


    Little Boy Blue, come, blow up your horn;

    Under the haystack, fast asleep.




LITTLE TOM TUCKER

OLD WOMAN, OLD WOMAN


    "Old woman, old woman, shall we go a-shearing?"

    "Speak a little louder, sir, I'm very thick of hearing."

    "Thank you, kind sir, I hear you very clearly."




UP HILL AND DOWN DALE


    Up hill and down dale;
    Butter is made in every vale;

    And make butter anon,
    Before her old grandmother
    Grows a young man.




LUCY LOCKET


    Lucy Locket

    Round it.

      Dickory,
        Dock!




ONE MISTY MOISTY MORNING


    One misty, moisty morning, when cloudy was the weather,
    There I met an old man clothed all in leather;
    He began to compliment and I began to grin,
    How do you do? how do you do? how do you do again?




THE LITTLE HUSBAND


    I had a little husband,
      No bigger than my thumb;
    I put him in a pint pot,
      And then I bade him drum.

    I bought a little horse,
      That galloped up and down;
    I bridled him, and saddled him,
      And sent him out of town.

    I gave him a pair of garters
      To tie up his little hose,
    And a little silk handkerchief
      To wipe his little nose.




TO THE HAYFIELD


    Willy boy, Willy boy, where are you going?
      I will go with you, if that I may.

    To stir the dancing daffodil.

    Scatters daisies at our feet.

    Skipping by their fleecy dams.

    Fills the children's hands with posies.

    Hot July brings cooling showers
    Apricots, and gillyflowers.

    Sportsmen then begin to shoot.

    Fresh October brings the pheasant;
    Then to gather nuts is pleasant.

    Dull November brings the blast;
    Then the leaves are whirling fast.

    Chill December brings the sleet,
    Blazing fire, and Christmas treat.




THE LITTLE MOPPET


    I had a little moppet,
      I put it in my pocket,
    And fed it with corn and hay,
      There came a proud beggar
      And swore he would have her,
    And stole my little moppet away.




SIMON BRODIE'S COW

I SAW A SHIP A SAILING


    I saw a ship a-sailing,
      A-sailing on the sea;
    And it was full of pretty things
      For baby and for me.

    There were sweetmeats in the cabin,
      And apples in the hold;
    The sails were made of silk,
      And the masts were made of gold.

    The four-and-twenty sailors
      That stood between the decks,
    Were four-and-twenty white mice,
      With chains about their necks.

    The captain was a duck,
      With a packet on his back;
    And when the ship began to move,
      The captain cried, "Quack, quack!"

    Pick up sticks;

    Seven, eight,
    Lay them straight;

    Nine, ten,
    A good fat hen;

    Eleven, twelve,
    Who will delve;

    Thirteen, fourteen,
    Maids a-courting;

    Fifteen, sixteen,
    Maids in the kitchen;

    Seventeen, eighteen,
    Maids a-waiting;

    Nineteen, twenty,
    My plate's empty.

JACK JINGLE


    Jack Jingle went 'prentice
      To make a horse-shoe,
    He wasted the iron
      Till it would not do.
    His master came in,
      And began for to rail;
    Says Jack, "the shoe's spoiled,
      But 't will still make a nail."

    He tried at the nail,
      But, chancing to miss,
    Says, "If it won't make a nail,
      It shall yet make a hiss."
    Then into the water
      Threw the hot iron, smack!
    "Hiss!" quoth the iron;
      "I thought so," says Jack.




BETTY WINKLE'S PIG


    Little Betty Winkle she had a little pig.
    It was a little pig, not very big;

    But now he's dead, and that's all over.
      Johnny Winkle he
        Sat down and cried;
      Betty Winkle she
        Lay down and died;
    So there was an end of one, two, and three,
      Johnny Winkle he,
      Betty Winkle she,
      And Piggy Wiggie!





THREE BRETHREN OUT OF SPAIN


    "We are three brethren out of Spain,
    Come to court your daughter Jane."
    "My daughter Jane she is too young;
    She has no skill in a flattering tongue."

    "Be she young, or be she old,
    It's for her gold she must be sold;
    So fare you well, my lady gay,
    We'll call again another day."

    "Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
    And rub thy spurs till they be bright."
    "Of my spurs take you no thought,
    For in this land they were not bought.
    So fare you well, my lady gay,
    We'll call again another day."

    "Turn back, turn back, thou scornful knight,
    And take the fairest in your sight."
    "The fairest maid that I can see
    Is pretty Nancy; come to me."




WHAT CARE I?


    What care I how black I be?
    Twenty pounds shall marry me.
    If twenty won't, forty shall,
    For I'm my mother's bouncing girl.




THE THREE KITTENS


    Three little kittens lost their mittens,
    And they began to cry,
      "Oh, Mother dear,
      We very much fear
    That we have lost our mittens!"

      "Lost your mittens!
      You naughty kittens!
    Then you shall have no pie.
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!
    No, you shall have no pie.
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"

    The three little kittens found their mittens,
    And they began to cry,
      "Oh, Mother dear,
      See here, see here,
    See, we have found our mittens!"

      "Put on your mittens,
      You silly kittens,
    And you shall have some pie.
      Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r!"
    "Oh, let us have the pie!
      Purr-r, purr-r, purr-r!"

    The three little kittens put on their mittens,
    And soon ate up the pie;
      "Oh, Mother dear,
      We greatly fear
    That we have soiled our mittens!"

      "Soiled your mittens!
      You naughty kittens!"
    Then they began to sigh,
      Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow!
    Then they began to sigh,
      Mi-ow, mi-ow, mi-ow!

    The three little kittens washed their mittens,
    And hung them up to dry;
      "Oh, Mother dear,
      Do you not hear
    That we have washed our mittens!"

      "Washed your mittens!
      Oh, you're good kittens!
    But I smell a rat close by.
      Hush! hush! mee-ow, mee-ow."
    "We smell a rat close by,
      Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"




THE LADY AND THE SWINE


    There was a lady loved a swine,
      Honey, quoth she,
    Pig-hog, wilt thou be mine?
      "Hoogh," quoth he.

    I'll build thee a silver stye,
      Honey, quoth she;
    And in it thou shalt lie;
      "Hoogh!" quoth he.

    Pinned with a silver pin,
      Honey, quoth she,
    That thou mayst go out and in;
      "Hoogh!" quoth he.

    Wilt thou now have me,
      Honey? quoth she;
    "Hoogh, hoogh, hoogh!" quoth he,
      And went his way.




THE JOLLY MILLER


    There was a jolly miller once
      Lived on the River Dee.
    He worked and sang from morn till night,
      No lark so blithe as he;
    And this the burden of his song
      For ever used to be:
    "I care for nobody! no, not I!
      And nobody cares for me!"




FEETIKINS


    "Feetikin, feetikin,

    Toddle and gang!"




TOM THE PIPER'S SON


    Tom, Tom, the piper's son,
    He learned to play when he was young,
    But all the tune that he could play
    Was "Over the hills and far away".
    Over the hills, and a great way off,
    And the wind will blow my top-knot off.

    Now Tom with his pipe made such a noise
    That he pleased both the girls and boys,
    And they stopped to hear him play
    "Over the hills and far away".

    Tom with his pipe did play with such skill
    That those who heard him could never stand still;
    Whenever they heard they began for to dance,
    Even pigs on their hind-legs would after him prance.

    As Dolly was milking the cow one day,
    Tom took out his pipe and began for to play;
    So Doll and the cow danced "the Cheshire round",
    Till the pail was broke, and the milk ran on the ground.

    He met old Dame Trot with a basket of eggs,
    He used his pipe, and she used her legs;
    She danced about till the eggs were all broke,
    She began for to fret, but he laughed at the joke.

    He saw a cross fellow was beating an ass,
    Heavy laden with pots, pans, dishes, and glass;
    He took out his pipe and played them a tune,
    And the jack-ass's load was lightened full soon.




DOCTOR FELL


    I do not like thee, Doctor Fell;
    The reason why I cannot tell.
    But this I know, and know full well,
    I do not like thee, Doctor Fell.




THE FIFTH OF NOVEMBER


    Please to remember
    The fifth of November,
      Gunpowder treason and plot.
    I see no reason
    Why gunpowder treason
      Should ever be forgot.
    Guy, Guy, Guy,
    Stick him up on high,
    Put him on the bonfire,
    And there let him die.




BILLY, BILLY


    "Billy, Billy, come and play,
    While the sun shines bright as day."

    "Yes, my Polly, so I will,
    For I love to please you still."

    "Billy, Billy, have you seen
    Sam and Betsy on the green?"

    "Yes, my Poll, I saw them pass,
    Skipping o'er the new-mown grass."

    "Billy, Billy, come along,
    And I will sing a pretty song."

    "O then, Polly, I'll make haste,
    Not one moment will I waste,

    But will come and hear you sing,
    And my fiddle I will bring."




MATTHEW, MARK, LUKE, AND JOHN


    Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
    Bless the bed that I lie on!
    Four corners to my bed,
    Five angels there lie spread;
    Two at my head,
    Two at my feet,
    One at my heart
    My soul to keep.




JOHNNY


    Johnny shall have a new bonnet,
      And Johnny shall go to the fair,
    And Johnny shall have a blue ribbon
      To tie up his bonny brown hair.

    And why may not I love Johnny?
      And why may not Johnny love me?
    And why may not I love Johnny
      As well as another body?

    And here's a leg for a stocking,
      And here's a foot for a shoe,
    And he has a kiss for his daddy,
      And two for his mammy, I trow.

    And why may not I love Johnny?
      And why may not Johnny love me?
    And why may not I love Johnny
      As well as another body?




SING, SING!


    Sing, sing! what shall I sing?
    The cat's run away with the pudding-bag string.
      Do, do, what shall I do?
      The cat has bit it quite in two.




PETER PIPER


    Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,
    A peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked;
    If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled pepper,
    Where's the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked?




NANCY DAWSON


    Nancy Dawson was so fine
    She wouldn't get up to serve the swine,
    She lies in bed till eight or nine,
    So its oh! poor Nancy Dawson.

    And do you ken Nancy Dawson, honey?
    The wife who sells the barley, honey?
    She won't get up to feed her swine,
    And do you ken Nancy Dawson, honey?




LONDON BRIDGE

MASTER I HAVE


    Master I have, and I am his man,
      Gallop a dreary dun;
    Master I have, and I am his man,
    And I'll get a wife as fast as I can;
    With a heighty gaily gamberally,
    Higgledy, piggledy, niggledy, niggledy,
      Gallop a dreary dun.




ROCK-A-BY, BABY


    Rock-a-by, baby, thy cradle is green;
    Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen;
    And Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring;
    And Johnny's a drummer, and drums for the king.




THE FARMER AND HIS DAUGHTER


    A Farmer went trotting upon his gray mare,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    With his daughter behind him so rosy and fair,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

    A raven cried "croak" and they all tumbled down,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    The mare broke her knees, and the farmer his crown,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!

    The mischievous raven flew laughing away,
      Bumpety, bumpety, bump!
    And vowed he would serve them the same the next day,
      Lumpety, lumpety, lump!




A STRANGE SIGHT


    Upon St. Paul's steeple stands a tree,
    As full of apples as may be;
    The little boys of London Town,
    They run with hooks and pull them down;
    And then they run from hedge to hedge,
    Until they come to London Bridge.




I'LL TRY


    Two Robin Redbreasts built their nest
      Within a hollow tree;
    The hen sat quietly at home,
      The cock sang merrily;
    And all the little ones said:
      "Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee."

    One day the sun was warm and bright,
      And shining in the sky,
    Cock Robin said: "My little dears,
      'Tis time you learned to fly;"
    And all the little young ones said:
      "I'll try, I'll try, I'll try."

    I know a child, and who she is
      I'll tell you by and by,
    When Mamma says "Do this," or "that,"
      She says "What for?" and "Why?"
    She'd be a better child by far
      If she would say "I'll try."




THE FOX AND THE GOOSE


    The fox and his wife they had a great strife,
    They never ate mustard in all their whole life;
    They ate their meat without fork or knife,
      And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!

    The fox jumped up on a moonlight night;
    The stars they were shining, and all things bright;
    "Oh, ho!" said the fox, "it's a very fine night
      For me to go through the town, e-ho!"

    The fox when he came to yonder stile,
    He lifted his lugs and he listened a while;
    "Oh, ho!" said the fox, "it's but a short mile
      From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!"

    The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,
    Whom should he see but the farmer's drake;
    "I love you well for your master's sake,
      And long to be picking your bones, e-ho!"

    The gray goose she ran round the hay-stack;
    "Oh, ho!" said the fox, "you are very fat,
    You'll grease my beard and ride on my back
      From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!"

    The farmer's wife she jumped out of bed,
    And out of the window she popped her head;
    "Oh, husband! oh, husband! the geese are all dead,
      For the fox has been through the town, e-ho!"

    Then the old man got up in his red cap,
    And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;
    But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,
      And ran through the town, the town, e-ho!

    When he got to the top of the hill,
    He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,
    For joy that he was in safety still,
      And had got away through the town, e-ho!

    When the fox came back to his den,
    He had young ones both nine and ten;
    "You're welcome home, daddy; you may go again,
      If you bring us such fine meat from the town, e-ho!"




WHERE ARE YOU GOING?


    "Where are you going to, my pretty maid?"
    "I'm going a-milking, sir," she said.

    "May I go with you, my pretty maid?"
    "You're kindly welcome, sir," she said.

    "What is your father, my pretty maid?"
    "My father's a farmer, sir," she said.

    "What is your fortune, my pretty maid?"
    "My face is my fortune, sir," she said.

    "Then I can't marry you, my pretty maid!"
    "Nobody asked you, sir," she said.




THE DIVISION OF LABOUR


    The cock's on the housetop, blowing his horn;
    The bull's in the barn, a-threshing of corn;
    The maids in the meadows are making of hay;
    The ducks in the river are swimming away.




KING PIPPIN'S HALL


    King Pippin built a fine new hall,
    Pastry and pie-crust were the wall;
    Windows made of black pudding and white,
    Slates were pancakes, you ne'er saw the like.




IF


    If all the world were apple-pie,
      And all the water ink,
    What should we do for bread and cheese?
      What should we do for drink?




COFFEE AND TEA


    Molly, my sister, and I fell out,
    And what do you think it was about?
    She loved coffee and I loved tea,
    And that was the reason we couldn't agree.




A WONDERFUL THING


    As I went to Bonner,
      I met a pig
      Without a wig,
    Upon my word and honour.




MY BOY TAMMIE


    "Where have you been all day,
      My boy Tammie?"

    "I've been all the day
    Courting of a lady gay;
    But oh, she's too young
    To be taken from her mammy!"

    "What work can she do,
      My boy Tammie?
    Can she bake and can she brew,
      My boy Tammie?"

    "She can brew and she can bake,
    And she can make our wedding cake;
    But oh, she's too young
    To be taken from her mammy!"

    "What age may she be?
    What age may she be,
      My boy Tammie?"

    "Twice two, twice seven,
    Twice ten, twice eleven;
    But oh, she's too young
    To be taken from her mammy!"




THE LITTLE MAN WITH A GUN


    There was a little man, and he had a little gun,
      And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead;
    He went to the brook, and saw a little duck,
      And shot it right through the head, head, head.

    He carried it home to his old wife Joan,
      And bade her a fire to make, make, make,
    To roast the little duck he had shot in the brook,
      And he'd go and fetch the drake, drake, drake.

    The drake was a-swimming, with his curly tail;
      The little man made it his mark, mark, mark.
    He let off his gun, but he fired too soon,
      And the drake flew away with a quack, quack, quack.




IF WISHES WERE HORSES

    If wishes were horses, beggars would ride;
    If turnips were watches, I would wear one by my side.




CLAP HANDIES


    Clap, clap handies,
    Mammie's wee, wee ain;
    Clap, clap handies,
    Daddie's comin' hame;
    Hame till his bonny wee bit laddie;
    Clap, clap handies,
    My wee, wee ain.




TAFFY WAS A WELSHMAN


    Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief;
    Taffy came to my house and stole a piece of beef;
    I went to Taffy's house, Taff was not at home;
    Taffy came to my house and stole a marrow bone.

    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was not in;
    Taffy came to my house and stole a silver pin;
    I went to Taffy's house, Taffy was in bed,
    I took up the beef bone and flung it at his head.




THERE WAS A MAN


    There was a man, and he had naught,
      And robbers came to rob him;
    He crept up to the chimney pot,
      And then they thought they had him.

    But he got down on t' other side,
      And then they could not find him;
    He ran fourteen miles in fifteen days,
      And never looked behind him.




JACK'S FIDDLE


    Jacky, come give me thy fiddle,
      If ever thou mean to thrive.
    Nay, I'll not give my fiddle
      To any man alive.

    If I should give my fiddle
      They'll think that I'm gone mad;
    For many a joyful day
      My fiddle and I have had.

THREE SHIPS


    I saw three ships come sailing by,
      Sailing by, sailing by,
    I saw three ships come sailing by,
      On New-Year's day in the morning.

    And what do you think was in them then,
      In them then, in them then?
    And what do you think was in them then,
      On New-Year's day in the morning?

    Three pretty girls were in them then,
      In them then, in them then,
    Three pretty girls were in them then,
      On New-Year's day in the morning.

    And one could whistle, and one could sing,
      And one could play on the violin,
    Such joy there was at my wedding,
      On New-Year's day in the morning.




THE CROOKED SONG


    There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile,
    He found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile;
    He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse,
    And they all lived together in a little crooked house.




A, B, C


    A, B, C, tumble down D,
    The cat's in the cupboard
    And can't see me.




COMICAL FOLK


    In a cottage in Fife
      Lived a man and his wife,
    Who, believe me, were comical folk;
      For, to people's surprise,
      They both saw with their eyes,
    And their tongues moved whenever they spoke.
      When they were asleep,
      I'm told--that to keep
    Their eyes open they could not contrive;
      They both walked on their feet,
      And 't was thought what they eat
    Helped, with drinking, to keep them alive.




DING, DONG, BELL.


    Ding, dong, bell, the cat is in the well!
    Who put her in?  Little Johnny Green.
    Who pulled her out?
    Little Tommy Stout.
    What a naughty boy was that,
    To try to drown poor pussy cat,
    Who never did him any harm,
    But killed the mice in his father's barn!




BOBBY SNOOKS


    Little Bobby Snooks was fond of his books,
     And loved by his usher and master;

    But naughty Jack Spry, he got a black eye,
     And carries his nose in a plaster.




SIX LITTLE MICE


    Six little mice sat down to spin,
    Pussy passed by, and she peeped in.
    "What are you at, my little men?"
    "Making coats for gentlemen."
    "Shall I come in and bite off your threads?"
    "No, no, Miss Pussy, you'll bite off our heads."
    "Oh, no, I'll not, I'll help you spin."
    "That may be so, but you don't come in."




WING, WANG, WADDLE, OH


    My father he died, but I can't tell you how,
    He left me six horses to drive in my plough;

THE HART


    The hart he loves the high wood,
      The hare she loves the hill;
    The Knight he loves his bright sword,
      The Lady--loves her will.




OLD CHAIRS TO MEND


    If I'd as much money as I could spend,
    I never would cry old chairs to mend;
    Old chairs to mend, old chairs to mend;
    I never would cry old chairs to mend.

    If I'd as much money as I could tell,
    I never would cry old clothes to sell;
    Old clothes to sell, old clothes to sell;
    I never would cry old clothes to sell.




SEE, SEE!


    See, see! what shall I see?
    A horse's head where his tail should be!




OLD MOTHER HUBBARD


    Mother Hubbard's old dog Tray,
    If this account be true,
    Had not an equal, I dare say,
    Come tell me, what think you?

    Old Mother Hubbard
    Went to her cupboard,
      To give her poor dog a bone;

    When she came there
    The cupboard was bare,
      And so the poor dog had none.

    She went to the baker's
      To buy him some bread,
    When she came back
      The dog was dead!

    She went to the undertaker's
      To buy him a coffin;
    When she came back
      The dog was laughing.

    She took a clean dish
      To get him some tripe;
    When she came back
      He was smoking his pipe.

    She went to the ale-house
      To get him some beer;
    When she came back
      The dog sat in a chair.

    She went to the tavern
      For white wine and red;
    When she came back
      The dog stood on his head.

    She went to the hatter's
      To buy him a hat;
    When she came back
      He was feeding the cat.

    She went to the barber's
      To buy him a wig;
    When she came back
      He was dancing a jig.

    She went to the fruiterer's
      To buy him some fruit;
    When she came back
      He was playing the flute.

    She went to the tailor's
      To buy him a coat;
    When she came back
      He was riding a goat.

    She went to the cobbler's
      To buy him some shoes;
    When she came back
      He was reading the news.

      To buy him some linen;
    When she came back
      The dog was spinning.

    She went to the hosier's
      To buy him some hose;
    When she came back
      He was dressed in his clothes.

    The dame made a curtsy,
      The dog made a bow;
    The dame said, "Your servant,"
      The dog said, "Bow-wow!"




TO BABYLON


    How many miles is it to Babylon?
      Threescore miles and ten.
    Can I get there by candle-light?
      Yes, and back again!
    If your heels are nimble and light,
    You may get there by candle-light.




MY BLACK HEN


    Hickety, pickety, my black hen,
    She lays eggs for gentlemen;
    Gentlemen come every day
    To see what my black hen doth lay.




I'LL TELL YOU A STORY


      I'll tell you a story
      About Jack a Nory--
    And now my story's begun:

      I'll tell you another,
      About Jack his brother--
    And now my story's done.
