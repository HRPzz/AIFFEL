Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
There's a blaze of light
In every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though
It all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half-crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her
Then he gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them
But he himself was broken, long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with her mind Now, Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river
She's wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they wil lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds her mirror And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you know that you can trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind Everybody knows that the dice are loaded
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
Everybody knows the war is over
Everybody knows the good guys lost
Everybody knows the fight was fixed
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich
That's how it goes
Everybody knows Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
Everybody knows that the captain lied
Everybody got this broken feeling
Like their father or their dog just died
Everybody talking to their pockets
Everybody wants a box of chocolates
And a long-stem rose
Everybody knows Everybody knows that you love me baby
Everybody knows that you really do
Everybody knows that you've been faithful
Ah, give or take a night or two
Everybody knows you've been discreet
But there were so many people you just had to meet
Without your clothes
And everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows And everybody knows that it's now or never
Everybody knows that it's me or you
And everybody knows that you live forever
Ah, when you've done a line or two
Everybody knows the deal is rotten
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton
For your ribbons and bows
And everybody knows And everybody knows that the Plague is coming
Everybody knows that it's moving fast
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman
Are just a shining artifact of the past
Everybody knows the scene is dead
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed
That will disclose
What everybody knows And everybody knows that you're in trouble
Everybody knows what you've been through
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary
To the beach of Malibu
Everybody knows it's coming apart
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart
Before it blows
And everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows Everybody knows Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love Now I've heard there was a secret chord

Dance me to the end of love I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary
"do you hate mankind for what they done to you? "
He said, "talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.
I've so little time and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through.
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,
Glad that I ran into you.
Tell the people that you saw me passing through. I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,
I said "now you're out, what are you going to do? "
"plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.
I said, "how come the men here suffer like they do? "
"men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right
Even though they know they're only passing through" Passing through, passing through ... I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.
He said, "one world must come out of world war two" (ah, the fool)
"yankee, russian, white or tan," he said, "a man is still a man.
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through." Passing through, passing through ... (let's do it one more time) Passing through, passing through ... The birds they sang
At the break of day
Start again
I heard them say
Don't dwell on what
Has passed away
Or what is yet to be
Yeah the wars they will
Be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again
Bought and sold
And bought again
The dove is never free Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in We asked for signs
The signs were sent
The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned, they've summoned up
A thundercloud
And they're going to hear from me (Ring, ring, ring, ring)
Ring the bells that still can ring Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in You can add up the parts
You won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart, every heart to love will come
But like a refugee (Ring, ring, ring, ring)
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in
Ring the bells that still can ring (ring the bells that still can ring)
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in Come over to the window, my little darling
I'd like to try to read your palm
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angels
And then the angels forget to pray for us Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again We met when we were almost young
Deep in the green lilac park
You held on to me like I was a crucifix
As we went kneeling through the dark Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Your letters, they all say that you're beside me now
Then why do I feel alone?
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web
Is fastening my ankle to a stone Now so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again For now I need your hidden love
I'm cold as a new razorblade
You left when I told you I was curious
I never said that I was brave Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again Oh, you are really such a pretty one
I see you've gone and changed your name again
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside
To wash my eyelids in the rain Oh, so long, Marianne
It's time that we began to laugh
And cry and cry and laugh about it all again I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
But now it's come to distances and both of us must try
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time
Walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme
You know my love goes with you as your love stays with me
It's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm
Your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm
Yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new
In city and in forest they smiled like me and you
But let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie
Your eyes are soft with sorrow
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye You came to me this morning
And you handled me like meat
You?d have to be a man to know
How good that feels, how sweet My mirror twin, my next of kin
I?d know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in
A thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I?m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep I know you had to lie to me
I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high
Behind the veils of sheer deceit Our perfect porn aristocrat
So elegant and cheap
I?m old but I?m still into that
A thousand kisses deep I?m good at love, I?m good at hate
It?s in between I freeze
Been working out but it?s too late
(It?s been too late for years) But you look good, you really do
They love you on the street
If you were here I?d kneel for you
A thousand kisses deep The autumn moved across your skin
Got something in my eye
A light that doesn?t need to live
And doesn?t need to die A riddle in the book of love
Obscure and obsolete
And witnessed here in time and blood
A thousand kisses deep But I?m still working with the wine
Still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
But the heart will not retreat I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray
I never had their sweet
But once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I?m just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep But you don?t need to hear me now
And every word I speak
It counts against me anyhow
A thousand kisses deep Like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight from some old-fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee
If I, if I have been unkind
I hope that you can just let it go by
If I, if I have been untrue
I hope you know it was never to you For like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me, "you must not ask for so much"
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
She cried to me, "hey, why not ask for more?"
Oh, like a bird on the wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man, it's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbows to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter Ah, you hate to see another tired man
Lay down his hand like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep you notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder You tell him to come in sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road, it opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this or any other matter
Well, he talks like this you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this you don't know what he's after Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform for the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say okay, the bridge or someplace later And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much, not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card that is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here,
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
I've seen the future, brother
It is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future
It is murder Things are going to slide
Slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see a woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin' Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St. Paul
Give me Christ or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
it is murder Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant
When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent)
I wonder what they meant When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent) In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In my secret life
In my secret life I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In my secret life
In my secret life Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of my secret life Looked through the paper
Makes you wanna cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In my secret life I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life
In my secret life I'm slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That's what my momma said I'm lacing up my shoe
But I don't want to run
I'll get here when I do
Don't need no starting gun It's not because I'm old
And it's not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood I always liked it slow:
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go:
With me it's got to last It's not because I'm old
It's not because I'm dead
I always liked it slow
That's what my momma said All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes I always liked it slow:
I never liked it fast
With you it's got to go:
With me it's got to last It's not because I'm old
It's not the life I led
I always liked it slow
That's what my momma said I'm slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last So baby let me go
You're wanted back in town
In case they want to know
I'm just trying to slow it down The ponies run, the girls are young
The odds are there to beat
You win a while and then it's done
Your little winning streak
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat
You live your life as if it's real
A thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
You lose your grip and then you slip
Into the masterpiece
And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive
A thousand kisses deep And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep Confined to sex we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me
I made it to the forward deck
I blessed our remnant fleet
And then consented to be wrecked
A thousand kisses deep I'm turning tricks I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
I guess they won't exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep
And quiet is the thought of you
The file on you complete
Except what we forgot to do
A thousand kisses deep And sometimes when the night is slow
The wretched and the meek
We gather up our hearts and go
A thousand kisses deep The ponies run, the girls are young
The odds are there to beat
You win a while and then it's done
Your little winning streak
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat
You live your life as if it's real
A thousand kisses deep I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it's better
Than before Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without the costume
That I wore He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living with defeat A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete I want to make him certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding
Which is to say what I have told him
To repeat Going home
Without my sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it's better
Than before Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without this costume
That I wore I'm going home
Without the sorrow
Going home
Sometime tomorrow
Going home
To where it's better
Than before Going home
Without my burden
Going home
Behind the curtain
Going home
Without this costume
That I wore I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord Hineni
Hineni, hineni
Hineni They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
For trying to change the system from within
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I'm guided by a signal in the heavens (guided, guided)
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin (guided, guided by)
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons (guided)
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I'd really like to live beside you, baby)
(I love your body and your spirit and your clothes)
(But you see that line there moving through the station?)
(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) Ah, you loved me as a loser
But now you're worried that I just might win
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin I don't like your fashion business, mister
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
I don't like what happened to my sister
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I'd really like to live beside you, baby)
(I love your body and your spirit and your clothes)
(But you see that line there moving through the station?)
(I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those) And I thank you for those items that you sent me, ha ha ha
The monkey and the plywood violin
I practiced every night, now I'm ready
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin (I am guided) Ah remember me, I used to live for music (baby)
Remember me, I brought your groceries in (ooh, baby, yeah)
Well, it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded (baby)
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin And who by fire, who by water
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial
Who in your merry-merry month of may
Who by very slow decay
And who shall I say is calling? And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt
Who by avalanche, who by powder
Who for his greed, who for his hunger
And who shall I say is calling? And who by brave assent, who by accident
Who in solitude, who in this mirror
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand
Who in mortal chains, who in power
And who shall I say is calling? If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you
If you want a partner, take my hand, or
If you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
I'm your man If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
I'm your man Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah, but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby and I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart, and I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please (please)
I'm your man And if you've got to sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you
If you want a father for your child
Or only want to walk with me a while across the sand
I'm your man If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you You can dance every dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile every smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moon light
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone
But don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin' save the last dance for me Baby, don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you, oh so much You can dance, go and carry on
'Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he walk you home, you must tell him no
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine
Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me So don't forget who's taking you home
Or in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling, save the last dance for me Oh baby, won't you save the last dance for me?
Oh baby, won't you promise that you'll save
The last dance for me>
Save the last dance, the very last dance for me Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows
There's a tree where the doves go to die
There's a piece that was torn from the morning
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws Oh, I want you, I want you, I want you
On a chair with a dead magazine
In the cave at the tip of the lilly
In some hallway where love's never been
On a bed where the moon has been sweating
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take its broken waist in your hand This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea There's a concert hall in Vienna
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking
They've been sentenced to death by the blues
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture
With a garland of freshly cut tears? I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years There's an attic where children are playing
Where I've got to lie down with you soon
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns
In the mist of some sweet afternoon
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow
All your sheep and your lillies of snow I, I-I-I
Take this waltz, take this waltz
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!" This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz
With its very own breath of brandy and Death
Dragging its tail in the sea And I'll dance with you in Vienna
I'll be wearing a river's disguise
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder
My mouth on the dew of your thighs
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook
With the photographs there, and the moss
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty
My cheap violin and my cross
And you'll carry me down on your dancing
To the pools that you lift on your wrist
Oh my love, oh my love
Take this waltz, take this waltz
It's yours now, it's all that there is (La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(I, I-I-I) Baby, I've been waiting,
I've been waiting night and day
I didn't see the time,
I waited half my life away
There were lots of invitations
And I know you sent me some
But I was waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come
I know you really loved me
But, you see, my hands were tied
And I know it must have hurt you,
It must have hurt your pride
To have to stand beneath my window
With your bugle and your drum
And me I'm up there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah I don't believe you'd like it,
You wouldn't like it here
There ain't no entertainment
And the judgments are severe
The Maestro says it's Mozart
But it sounds like bubble gum
When you're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Waiting for the miracle
There's nothing left to do
I haven't been this happy
Since the end of World War II Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come I dreamed about you, baby
It was just the other night
Most of you was naked
Ah but some of you was light
The sands of time were falling
From your fingers and your thumb
And you were waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Ah baby, let's get married
We've been alone too long
Let's be alone together
Let's see if we're that strong
Yeah let's do something crazy,
Something absolutely wrong
While we're waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come Nothing left to do
When you know that you've been taken
Nothing left to do
When you're begging for a crumb
Nothing left to do
When you've got to go on waiting
Waiting for the miracle to come When you've fallen on the highway
And you're lying in the rain,
And they ask you how you're doing
Of course you'll say you can't complain
If you're squeezed for information,
That's when you've got to play it dumb
You just say you're out there waiting
For the miracle, for the miracle to come You got me singing
Even tho' the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on You got me singing
Even tho' it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on You got me singing
Even tho' it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song Whither thou goest, I will go;
Wherever thou lodgest, I will lodge:
Thy people shall be my people ...
Whither thou goest, I will go. (taken from the Book of Ruth, ch.1; v. 16) Ah we're drinking and we're dancing
And the band is really happening
And the Johnny Walker wisdom running high
And my very sweet companion
She's the angel of compassion
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh
And every drinker every dancer
Lifts a happy face to thank her
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime
All the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time) Yeah the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time Ah we're lonely, we're romantic
And the cider's laced with acid
And the holy spirit's crying, where's the beef?
And the moon is swimming naked
And the summer night is fragrant
With a mighty expectation of relief
So we struggle and we stagger
Down the snakes and up the ladder
To the tower where the blessed hours chime
And I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time) I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
(I can't say much has happened since)
We're closing time
Closing time I loved you for your beauty
But that doesn't make a fool of me
You were in it for your beauty too
And I loved you for your body
There's a voice that sounds like god to me
Declaring, (declaring) declaring,declaring that your body's really you
And I loved you when our love was blessed
And I love you now there's nothing left
But sorrow and a sense of overtime
And I missed you since the place got wrecked
And I just don't care what happens next
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time) Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex
Looks like freedom but it feels like death
It's something in between, I guess
It's closing time Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing
But there's nothing really happening
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night
And my very close companion
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing
She's a hundred but she's wearing
Something tight
And I lift my glass to the awful truth
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth
Except to say it isn't worth a dime
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time) The whole damn place goes crazy twice
And it's once for the devil and once for Christ
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights
We're busted in the blinding lights
(Busted in the blinding lights)
Busted in the blinding lights
Of closing time
Closing time Oh the women tear their blouses off
And the men they dance on the polka-dots
It's closing time
And it's partner found, it's partner lost
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops
It's closing time
I swear it happened just like this
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss
It's closing time (closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time)
(Closing time) The gates of love they budged an inch
I can't say much has happened since
But closing time (closing time, closing time, closing time) I loved you when our love was blessed
I love you now there's nothing left
But closing time
I miss you since the place got wrecked
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex Oh, the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song
Oh, I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long Yes, you who must leave everything that you cannot control
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul
Well, I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned Well, they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right
We weren't lovers like that and besides, it would still be all right Store Room Its not the wind that keeps you up,
Its not the snow
Its not the moon
coming like a headlight
through your window
Its not the thumbnail of a screen
That scrapes away your dream It's just this man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, Its not the news of burning towns
That ruins your mind
like a spoon you turn and you turn
But it wont unwind
Though these wars you did not start
They dont tear your sleep apart It's just a man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, And now this woman by your side
Well shes is asleep
And there's nothing you can give her,
and there's nothing you want to keep
You don't even try to prove that the noise is
neighbours making love. It's just a man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, Well go to sleep and change the locks
When you wake up
Share your toast maybe
spill some coffee from your cup
Oh theres nothing left to choose
And there is so much more to loose. Theres this man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, Its not the wind that keeps you up,
Its not the snow
Its not the moon
coming like a headlight
through your window
Its not the thumbnail of a screen
That scrapes away your dream It's just a man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, Its not the news of burning towns
That ruins your mind

But wont unwind
No these wars you did not start

Hes got nothing left to choose
And youve got so much more to loose. It's just a man,
Taking what he needs,
From the store room, It's four in the morning, the end of December
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear
Did you ever go clear? Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder
You'd been to the station to meet every train, and
You came home without Lili Marlene And you treated my woman to a flake of your life
And when she came back she was nobody's wife Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth
One more thin gypsy thief
Well, I see Jane's awake
She sends her regards And what can I tell you my brother, my killer
What can I possibly say?
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you
I'm glad you stood in my way If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me
Well, your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes
I thought it was there for good so I never tried And Jane came by with a lock of your hair
She said that you gave it to her
That night that you planned to go clear Sincerely, L Cohen When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished. I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, "résigne toi"
Mais je n'ai pas peur
J'ai repris mon âme J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la France entière Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows I asked my father,
I said, "father change my name."
The one I'm using now it's covered up
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame. Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. He said, "i locked you in this body,
I meant it as a kind of trial.

Or to make some woman smile." Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me,
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. "then let me start again," i cried,

And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will
If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring

All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing If it be your will
If there is a choice
Let the rivers fill
Let the hills rejoice
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will If it be your will I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up. I got no future,
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too I shoulda seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price. I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup
I said is this contagious?
You said just drink it up Well, my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song I said to Hank Williams, how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
Oh, a hundred floors above me in the Tower of Song I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here in the Tower of Song So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah, they don't let a woman kill you, not in the Tower of Song Now, you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices in the Tower of Song I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly from a window in the Tower of Song Yeah, my friends are gone and my hair is gray
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day in the Tower of Song I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so free
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
And those were the reasons and that was New York
I was running for the money and the flesh
That was called love for the workers in song
It still is for those of us left.
But you got away, didn't you, baby?
You just threw it all to the crowd
You got away, they can't pay you now
For making your sweet little song
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
In the winter of 67
My friends of that year they were all trying to go queer
And me I was just getting even
And those were the reasons and that was New York
I was running for the money and the flesh
That was called love for the workers in song
It still is for those of us left
But you got away, didn't you, baby?
You just threw it all to the crowd
You got away, they can't pay you now
For making your sweet little song I loved you for a long, long time
I know this love is real
It don't matter how it all went wrong
That don't change the way I feel
And I can't believe that time is
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I'm aching for you baby
I can't pretend I'm not
I need to see you naked
In your body and your thought
I've got you like a habit
And I'll never get enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love (There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never ever find that cure for love
(There ain't no drink, no drug) ah, tell them, angels
(There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love) I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up
I see your hand, I see your hair
Your bracelets and your brush
And I call to you, I call to you
But I don't call soft enough
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love I walked into this empty church, I had no place else to go
When the sweetest voice I ever heard whispered to my soul
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much
It's written in the scriptures
It's written there in blood
And I even heard the angels declare it from above
There ain't no cure, there ain't no cure, there ain't no cure for love (There ain't no cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky
The holy books are open wide
The doctors working day and night
But they'll never-ever find that (cure for love), that cure for love
(That cure for love)
(There ain't no cure for love)
(No cure for love, there ain't no cure for love) There was a child named Bernadette
I heard the story long ago
She saw the Queen of Heaven once
And kept the vision in her soul
No one believed what she had seen
No one believed what she heard
But there were sorrows to be here
And mercy, mercy in this world So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do We've been around, we fall, we fly
We mostly fall, we mostly run
And every now and then we try
To mend the damage that we've done
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest
I've got this joy inside my breast
To think that I did not forget that child
That song of Bernadette So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine
Torn by what we've done and can't undo
I just want to hold you, won't let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do
I just want to hold you, come on let me hold you
Like Bernadette would do The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find The story's told
With facts and lies
I have a name
But nevermind Nevermind
Nevermind
The war was lost
The treaty signed There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So nevermind Your victory
Was so complete
Some among you
Thought to keep A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons, our knives The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands And all of this
Expressions of
The sweet indifference
Some call love The high indifference
Some call fate
But we had names
More intimate Names so deep and
Names so true
They're blood to me
They're dust to you There is no need
That this survive
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies Nevermind
Nevermind
I live the life
I left behind There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So nevermind I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried I failed You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them
Whom you despise This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind Nevermind
Nevermind
I had to leave my life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So nevermind Nevermind
Nevermind
I live the life
I left behind I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life I left behind The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised It's coming through a hole in the air
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel
That this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account
Of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence
On the dock of the bay,
From the brave, the bold, the battered
Heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away:
Democracy is coming to the USA Sail on, sail on
Oh mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the Squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best and of the worst
It's here they got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
The river's going to weep,
And the mountain's going to shout Amen
It's coming like the tidal flood
Beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious
In amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of State
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
I love the country but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right
I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags
As time cannot decay
I'm junk but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to the USA
To the USA Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
À la Manic
Tu m'écrirais bien plus souvent
À la Manicouagan
Parfois je pense à toi si fort
Je recrée ton âme et ton corps
Je te regarde et m'émerveille
Je me prolonge en toi
Comme le fleuve dans la mer
Et la fleur dans l'abeille Que deviennent quand j'suis pas là,
Mon bel amour,
Ton front doux comme fine soie
Et tes yeux de velours?
Te tournes-tu vers la côte nord
Pour voir un peu, pour voir encore
Ma main qui te fait signe d'attendre?
Soir et matin je tends les bras
Je te rejoins où que tu sois
Et je te garde Dis-moi c' qui s' passe à Trois-Rivières
Et à Québec
Là où la vie a tant à faire
Et tout c' qu'on fait avec
Dis-moi c' qui s' passe à Montréal,
Dans les rues sales et transversales
Où tu es toujours la plus belle,
Car la laideur ne t'atteint pas,
Toi que j'aimerai jusqu'au trépas,
Mon éternelle Nous autres on fait les fanfarons
À coeur de jour
Mais on est tous de bons larrons
Cloués à leurs amours.
Y en a qui jouent de la guitare,
D'autres qui jouent d' l'accordéon
Pour passer l' temps quand y est trop long
Mais moi, je joue de mes amours
Et je danse en disant ton nom,
Tellement je t'aime Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
À la Manic
Tu m'écrirais bien plus souvent
À la Manicouagan
Si t'as pas grand'chose à me dire,
Écris cent fois les mots «Je t'aime»:
Ça fera le plus beau des poèmes.
Je le lirai cent fois...
Cent fois cent fois c'est pas beaucoup
Pour ceux qui s'aiment Si tu savais comme on s'ennuie
À la Manic
Tu m'écrirais bien plus souvent
À la Manicouagan. Tell me again
When I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again
We're alone and I'm listening
I'm listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you want me then Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Tell me again
When the victims are singing
And the laws of remorse are restored
Tell me again
That you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the Lord
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Tell me again
When the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again
When the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you need me then Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen Tell me again
When the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again
When the rest of the culture
Has passed through the eye of the camp
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen I knew that it was wrong
I didn't have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out I said I best be moving on
You said, we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young it
Took my breath away Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too Now I'm living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I'm old and I've had to settle
On a different point of view I was fighting with temptation
But I didn't want to win
A man like me don't like to see
Temptation caving in Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too O gather up the brokenness
And bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow The splinters that you carry
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The heart beneath is teaching
To the broken heart above Let the heavens falter
Let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the altar
Come healing of the name O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb Now the flames they followed joan of arc
As she came riding through the dark;
No moon to keep her armour bright,
No man to get her through this very smoky night.
She said, I'm tired of the war,
I want the kind of work I had before,
A wedding dress or something white
To wear upon my swollen appetite. Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way,
You know I've watched you riding every day
And something in me yearns to win
Such a cold and lonesome heroine.
And who are you? she sternly spoke
To the one beneath the smoke.
Why, I'm fire, he replied,
And I love your solitude, I love your pride. Then fire, make your body cold,
I'm going to give you mine to hold,
Saying this she climbed inside
To be his one, to be his only bride.
And deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And high above the wedding guests
He hung the ashes of her wedding dress. It was deep into his fiery heart
He took the dust of joan of arc,
And then she clearly understood
If he was fire, oh then she must be wood.
I saw her wince, I saw her cry,
I saw the glory in her eye.
Myself I long for love and light,
But must it come so cruel, and oh so bright? Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Or are we still leaning
Across the old table Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees whither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You don't need to answer Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
And are we still leaning
Across the old table Getting sick of starting over
On the same
Argument
We could sit around and talk it over
Or take a trip
To clear our minds
At the entrance of Mount Wilson
It's feeling like the right decision
Some times you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Park the car and hit the trail
The air feels sharp
On our skin
We'll see the snow as it is melting
Spring must be on
Her way again
We didn't see her coming for us
I guess that's mother nature's way
Sometimes you go outside
To get inside
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late
Trapped beneath the wall of snow
You're only ten
Feet away
Silence has a way of speaking
Only now
Do we understand
If I could only hear you say
That you are down but you're ok
We should have said the things we felt
Is it too late I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little shoe
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to look through I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all in a ruin I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your blizzard of ice
Oh please let me come into the storm Sometimes I find I get to
Thinking of the past
We swore to each other then
Our love would surely last You kept right on loving
I went on a fast
Now I am too thin
And your love is too vast But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while I choose the rooms that I live in with care
The windows are small and the walls almost bare
There's only one bed and there's only one prayer
I listen all night for your step on the stair But I know from your eyes
And I know from your smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while Oh, sometimes I see her undressing for me
She's the soft naked lady love meant her to be
And she's moving her body so brave and so free
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory And I know from her eyes
And I know from her smile
That tonight will be fine
Will be fine, will be fine, will be fine
For a while And I know
And I know
And I know Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder,
They slip between the sentries of the heart Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine It's not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window, drink it in
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again And you who had the honor of her evening,
And by the honor had your own restored
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her Lord Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked
Do not choose a coward's explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost It`s going to happen very soon.
The great event which will end the horror.
Which will end the sorrow.
Next Tuesday, when the sun goes down,
I will play the Moonlight Sonata backwards. This will reverse the effects of the world`s mad plunge into suffering,
For the last 200 million years.
What a lovely night that would be.
What a sigh of relief, as the senile robins become bright red again, And the retired nightingales,
Pick up their dusty tails,
And assert the majesty of creation! Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Tho' the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend to give me
Comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
You were talking so brave and so sweet,
Giving me head on the unmade bed,
While the limousines wait in the street.
Those were the reasons and that was New York,
We were running for the money and the flesh.
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left. Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,
You just turned your back on the crowd,
You got away, I never once heard you say,
I need you, I don't need you,
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around. I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend.
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception.
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind,
We are ugly but we have the music." And then you got away, didn't you babe
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel,
That's all, I don't even think of you that often. I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don't get high with you I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine They're dancing in the street, it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm sorry for the ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me I haven't said a word since you've been gone
That any liar couldn't say as well
I just can't believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my aerial The fields are crying out, it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm sorry for the ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty
I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him/her to my loved one and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him/her to my loved one and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My I tried to leave you, I don't deny
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times
I'd wake up every morning by your side The years go by, you lose your pride
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside
And all your work it's right before your eyes Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied
The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide
And here's a man still working for your smile If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
That's how it would be
My life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world
Without a trace
Oh well that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil
And see your face And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day
Had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt
Could ever heal
Well that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real The door it opened slowly
My father he came in
I was nine years old
And he stood so tall above me
His blue eyes they were shining
And his voice was very cold He said, "I've had a vision
And you know I'm strong and holy
I must do what I've been told"
So he started up the mountain
I was running, he was walking
And his axe was made of gold Well, the trees they got much smaller
The lake, a lady's mirror
We stopped to drink some wine
Then he threw the bottle over
Broke a minute later
And he put his hand on mine Thought I saw an eagle
But it might have been a vulture
I never could decide
Then my father built an altar
He looked once behind his shoulder
He knew I would not hide You who build these altars now
To sacrifice these children
You must not do it anymore
A scheme is not a vision
And you never have been tempted
By a demon or a God You who stand above them now
Your hatchets blunt and bloody
You were not there before
When I lay upon a mountain
And my father's hand was trembling
With the beauty of the word And if you call me brother now
Forgive me if I inquire
"Just according to whose plan?"
When it all comes down to dust
I will kill you if I must
I will help you if I can When it all comes down to dust
I will help you if I must
I will kill you if I can
And mercy on our uniform
Man of peace or man of war
The peacock spreads his fan I'm traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright
My fallen star I'm running late
They'll close the bar
I used to play
One mean guitar I guess I'm just
Somebody who
Has given up
On the me and you
I'm not alone
I've met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do Goodnight goodnight
My fallen star
I guess you're right
You always are I know you're right
About the blues
You live some life
You'd never choose I'm just a fool
A dreamer who
Forgot to dream
Of the me and you
I'm not alone
I've met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do Traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright
My fallen star I'm running late
They'll close the bar
I used to play
One mean guitar I guess I'm just
Somebody who
Has given up
On the me and you
I'm not alone
I've met a few
Traveling light like
We used to do But if the road
Leads back to you
Must I forget
The things I knew
When I was friends
With one or two
Traveling light like
We used to do
I'm traveling light Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said "won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see
Your naked body?" Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said "no you cannot see"
She said "no you cannot see
My naked body" So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body [Dedicated to Irving Layton] So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon. By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
In Babylon. And I did forget
My holy song
And I had no strength
In Babylon. By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me. And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark. And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring, I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me. By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
To Babylon. Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, â??This heart
It is not yours.' And he gave the wind
My wedding ring
And he circled us
With everything. By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
In Babylon. Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him. Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
My Babylon. I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me. By the rivers dark,
Where it all goes on
By the rivers dark
In Babylon. Trav'ling lady, stay awhile
Until the night is over.
I'm just a station on your way,
I know I'm not your lover.
Well I lived with a child of snow
When I was a soldier,
And I fought every man for her
Until the nights grew colder. She used to wear her hair like you
Except when she was sleeping,
And then she'd weave it on a loom
Of smoke and gold and breathing. And why are you so quiet now
Standing there in the doorway?
You chose your journey long before
You came upon this highway. Traveling lady stay awhile
Until the night is over.
I'm just a station on your way,
I know I'm not your lover. Steer your way through the ruins
Of the altar and the mall
Steer your way through the fables
Of creation and the fall
Steer your way past the palaces
That rise above the rot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought Steer your heart past the truth
You believed in yesterday
Such as fundamental goodness
And the wisdom of the way
Steer your heart, precious heart
Past the women whom you bought
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought Steer your path through the pain
That is far more real than you
That smashed the cosmic model
That blinded every view
And please don't make me go there
Tho' there be a god or not
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought They whisper still, the ancient stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa which you've probably forgot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought Steer your way, o my heart
Tho' I have no right to ask
To the one who was never
Never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted
Who knows he will be shot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought They whisper still, the ancient stones
The blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy
Let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa which you gradually forgot
Year by year
Month by month
Day by day
Thought by thought I stumbled out of bed
I got ready for the struggle
I smoked a cigarette
And I tightened up my gut
I said this can't be me
Must be my double
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what
I'm burning up the road
I'm heading down to Phoenix
I got this old address
Of someone that I knew
It was high and fine and free
Ah, you should have seen us
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember who I'll be there today
With a big bouquet of cactus
I got this rig that runs on memories
And I promise, cross my heart,
They'll never catch us
But if they do, just tell them it was me Yeah I loved you all my life
And that's how I want to end it
The summer's almost gone
The winter's tuning up
Yeah, the summer's gone
But a lot goes on forever
And I can't forget, I can't forget
I can't forget but I don't remember what I had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Beggin' my crazy to quit I had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye Had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all I'm tired of choosing desire
I've been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave Sometimes I'd head for the highway
I'm old and the mirrors don't lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye I had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone There is a war between the rich and poor,
A war between the man and the woman.
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war
And the ones who say there isn't.
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it,
Why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. Well I live here with a woman and a child,
The situation makes me kind of nervous.
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love"
I call it service. Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist,
Why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us,
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. You cannot stand what I've become,
You much prefer the gentleman I was before.
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control,
I didn't even know there was a war. Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed,
Why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. There is a war between the rich and poor,
A war between the man and the woman.
There is a war between the left and right,
A war between the black and white,
A war between the odd and the even. Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden,
Why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even,
Why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking? Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
Show me the place, I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bend and low
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began The troubles came, I saved what I could save
A shred of light, a particle away
But there were chains so I hastened to the hay
There were chains, so I loved you
Like a spade Show me the place, where you want your slave to go
Show me the place, I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place, where you want your slave to go The troubles came, I saved what I could save
A shred of light, a particle away
But there were chains so I hastened to the hay
There were chains so I loved you like a slave Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place, where the word became a man
Show me the place, where the suffering began I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I don't know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you, oh no, no
It's a crying shame
If I ever loved you
If I knew your name You don't need a lawyer
I'm not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I'm not taking aim
I don't need a lover, no, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don't need a lover
So blow out the flame There's nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We're cutting the cord
We're spending the treasure, oh no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored I don't need a reason
For what I became
I've got these excuses
They're tired and they're lame
I don't need a pardon, no no, no no, no
There's no one left to blame
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game Sleep baby sleep
The day's on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now they've fallen in love
They're talking in tongues If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby Sleep baby sleep
There's a morning to come
The wind in the trees
They're talking in tongues If your heart is torn
I don't wonder why
If the night is long
Here's my lullaby
Here's my lullaby I cannot follow you, my love,
You cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be. You know who I am,
You've stared at the sun,
Well I am the one who loves
Changing from nothing to one. Sometimes I need you naked,
Sometimes I need you wild,
I need you to carry my children in
And I need you to kill a child.
You know who I am If you should ever track me down
I will surrender there
And I will leave with you one broken man
Whom I will teach you to repair.
You know who I am I cannot follow you, my love,
You cannot follow me.
I am the distance you put between
All of the moments that we will be.
You know who I am Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice I practiced all my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumors of my virtue
They moved her not at all I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothed to black
And where I would surrender
Now I would attack I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned One by one, the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The open-hearted many
The broken-hearted few
And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now And those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep begin
And "welcome, welcome" cries a voice
"Let all my guests come in" And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now And all go stumbling through that house
In lonely secrecy
Saying "do reveal yourself"
Or "why has thou forsaken me?" And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now All at once the torches flare
The inner door flies open
One by one they enter there
In every style of passion And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now And here they take their sweet repast
While house and grounds dissolve
And one by one the guests are cast beyond the garden wall And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now Those who dance, begin to dance
Those who weep begin
Those who earnestly are lost
Are lost and lost again And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now One by the guests arrive
The guests are coming through
The broken-hearted many
The open-hearted few And no one knows where the night is going
And no one knows why the wine is flowing
Oh, love I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you, oh
I need you now
