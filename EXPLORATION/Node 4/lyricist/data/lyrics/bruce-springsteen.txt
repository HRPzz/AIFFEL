[Verse 1]
They come from everywhere
A longing to be free
They come to join us here
From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream
As people always will
To be safe and warm
In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door
Instead of opening the gate
Aw, let's turn this thing around
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great [Verse 2]
Don't tell me a lie
And sell it as a fact
I've been down that road before
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me
That you never read a book
I never put my faith
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path
And tempt the hands of fate
Aw, let's turn this thing around
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great In the quiet of the night
I lie here wide awake
And I ask myself
Is there a difference I can make? [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great I come from down in the valley
Where mister when you're young
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we'd ride Then I got Mary pregnant
And man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
No flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember
Mary acts like she don't care But I remember us riding in my brother's car
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true
Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river
Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river
My baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey, that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling, you know just what I'm here for
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty but, hey, you're alright
Oh, and that's alright with me You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a savior to rise from these streets
Well now, I ain't no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey, what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Well, the night's busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey, I know it's late, we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road
Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
And in the lonely cool before dawn
You hear their engines rolling on
But when you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind
So Mary, climb in
It's a town full of losers, I'm pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere
I'm just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on baby this laugh's on me Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey baby Well, it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again
And it seems like I'll be wearing the same old chains
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set me free
And I know someday I will find the key
And I know somewhere I will find the key Well, it seems like I've been playing your game way too long
And it seems the game I've played has made you strong
But when the game is over I won't walk out the loser
Yeah I know that I'll walk out of here again
Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again But now, I'm trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been sleeping in your bed too long
And it seems like you've been meaning to do me harm
But I'll teach my eyes to see, beyond these walls in front of me
And someday I'll walk out of here again
Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again But now, I'm trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I've been playing your game way too long
And it seems the game I've played has made you strong Because, I'm trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah I'm trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
Trapped, oh yeah
I'm trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line
H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes, girl we were Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend
I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
H-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire
`Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I want to know if love is wild
Babe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight
In an everlasting kiss One, two, three, four! The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
H-Oh, Someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place
Where we really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun
But till then tramps like us
Baby we were born to run Oh honey, tramps like us
Baby we were born to run Come on with me, tramps like us
Baby we were born to run Men walking 'long the railroad tracks
Going someplace, there's no going back
Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
Shelter line stretching 'round the corner
Welcome to the new world order
Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
No home, no job, no peace, no rest Well the highway is alive tonight
But nobody's kidding nobody about where it goes
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
You got a one-way ticket to the promised land
You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
Bathing in the city's aqueduct Go! Well the highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad Now Tom said, "Mom, wherever there's a cop beating a guy
Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
Look for me, Mom, I'll be there Wherever somebody's fighting for a place to stand
Or a decent job or a helping hand
Wherever somebody's struggling to be free
Look in their eyes, Ma, and you'll see me"
Yeah! The highway is alive tonight
Where it's headed everybody knows
I'm sitting down here in the campfire light
With the ghost of old Tom Joad It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky
Musta been a tear from your eye
Everything'll be okay
Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
Musta been you sighin' so deep
Don't worry we're gonna find a way I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
I'm waitin' on a sunny day Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down
I'm half a party in a one dog town
I need you to chase the blues away
Without you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
An ice cream truck on a deserted street
I hope that you're coming to stay I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waitin' on a sunny day Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all
Sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall
Sure as the turnin' of the night into day
Your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes
Lifts away the blues when I rise
I hope that you're coming to stay I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
Gonna chase the clouds away
Waitin' on a sunny day Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light
Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East
He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don't do it here
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
He said, take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boy, you're on your own
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he'd be all right He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Oh, but Mama, that's where the fun is
Ooh yeah
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded
I was blinded Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone, mmm mmm
I got a bad desire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Tell me now baby is he good to you
And can he do to you the things that I do, oh no
I can take you higher
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
Edgy and dull and cut a six inch valley
Through the middle of my soul At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
And a freight train running through the middle of my head
Only you, can cool my desire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire
Oh, ho ho, I'm on fire Woo ooo ooo
Woo ooo
Ooo ooo ooo
Woo ooo ooo
Woo ooo ooo I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speed ball by you
Make you look like a fool boy Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was Glory days, well they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed Her and her husband Bobby, well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times,
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days I think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm going to drink till I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory of, well time slips away
And leaves you with nothing mister but
Boring stories of glory days Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days Well they'll pass you by

'Cause without you my life just wouldn't be the same

To brush the sunlight from your hair
I'll be there to guide you when trouble walks beside you
If you need me I'll be there

And when those mean days come along
We'll stand together and we'll take 'em on

Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A. Come back home to the refinery
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"
Went down to see my V.A. man

Fighting off the Viet Cong
They're still there, he's all gone He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
Out by the gas fires of the refinery
I'm ten years burning down the road
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.

Badlands Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
I went out for a ride and I never went back
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart I met her in a Kingstown bar
We fell in love I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart Everybody needs a place to rest
Everybody wants to have a home
Don't make no difference what nobody says
Ain't nobody like to be alone Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part
Everybody's got a hungry heart I see you walking, baby, down the street
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet
I see the lonely ribbon in your hair
Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there You never smile girl, you never speak
You just walk on by, darlin' week after week
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world
Must be a lonely life for a working girl Little girl, I want to marry you
Oh yeah, little girl, I want to marry you
Yes I do
Little girl, I want to marry you Now honey, I don't want to clip your wings
But a time comes when two people should think of these things
Having a home and a family
Facing up to their responsibilities
They say in the end true love prevails
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along Little girl, I want to marry you
Oh yeah, little girl, I want to marry you
Yes I do
Little girl, I want to marry you Oh, my daddy said right before he died
That true, true love was just a lie
He went to his grave a broken heart
An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard Oh, darlin'
There's something happy and there's something sad
'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad
I wear my love darlin', without shame
I'd be proud if you would wear my name Oh
My darlin'
Ooh my darlin'
My darlin'
Oh oh Well It's Saturday night
You're all dressed up in blue
I been watching you awhile
Maybe you been watching me too
So somebody ran out
Left somebody's heart in a mess
Well if you're looking for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest Some girls they want a handsome Dan
Or some good-lookin' Joe
On their arm some girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo
Well 'round here baby
I learned you get what you can get
So if you're rough enough for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest The road is dark
And it's a thin thin line
But I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time
Maybe your other boyfriends
Couldn't pass the test
Well if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest Well it ain't no secret
I've been around a time or two
Well I don't know baby maybe you've been around too
Well there's another dance
All you gotta do is say yes
And if you're rough and ready for love
Honey I'm tougher than the rest
If you're rough enough for love
Baby I'm tougher than the rest I don't need your answered prayers
Or the chains your lover wears
I don't need your rings of gold
Or the secrets that you hold
Lift me up, darling
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up
Let your love lift me up I don't need your sacred vow
Or the promise tomorrow brings
There behind the morning clouds
I'll take the faith the daylight brings
Lift me up, darling
Lift me up, and I'll fall with you lift me up
Let your love lift me up When the morning bright
Lifts away this night
And the light above
We will find our love, we will find our love Your skin, your hand upon my neck
This skin, your fingers on my skin
This kiss, this heartbeat this breath
This heart, this heart this wilderness
Lift me up darling
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up
Let your love lift me up I hold you in my arms
As the band plays
What are those words whispered baby
Just as you turn away
I saw you last night
Out on the edge of town
I want to read your mind
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found
So tell me what I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you baby
Or just a brilliant disguise I heard somebody call your name
From underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame
Underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard baby
But I just can't see
What a woman like you
Is doing with me
So tell me who I see
When I look in your eyes
Is that you baby
Or just a brilliant disguise Now look at me baby
Struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart
When out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
I walk this world in wealth
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself Now you play the loving woman
I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close
Into the palm of my hand
We stood at the alter
The gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me
You better look hard and look twice
Is that me baby
Or just a brilliant disguise Tonight our bed is cold
Lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man
Who doubts what he's sure of So let the frozen sands crumble, crumble and fall
Yeah that's all right, I don't mind at all
Well let it all tumble right into the sea
Yeah that's all right, that's fine with me
Since you came down the line
I don't sleep at night
I got one thing on my mind
And so every day, every night
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
'cause you're so out of sight
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do Well I lost my job at the texaco station
Instead of pumpin' gas I dreamed of you
I got thrown out of my house
I got such a bad reputation
'cause all I wanna do is be seen with you They gave me my pay and said walk
I don't care what they say
Go ahead and let 'em all talk
Until the world falls apart
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do
Until they rip out my heart
I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
That's what I wanna do Bedtime, hold tight, love me just a little bit
All night, a little bit more
Tonight, tonight ...
Oh I don't know, I don't know
I don't understand ityou ain't pretty at all
But I come when you whisper
I run when you call
And baby I can't stand it
And baby that's all
Ridin' by your side in my car
Oh, oh I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Darlin' don't you know
Oh, oh I wanna be with you
I wanna be with you
Because I love you so I was tryin' to find my way home
But all I heard was a drone
Bouncing off a satellite
Crushin' the last lone American night This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there? I was spinnin' 'round a dead dial
Just another lost number in a file
Dancin' down a dark hole
Just searchin' for a world with some soul This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
Is there anybody alive out there? I just want to hear some rhythm
I just want to hear some rhythm
I just want to hear some rhythm
I just want to hear some rhythm I want a thousand guitars
I want pounding drums
I want a million different voices speaking in tongues This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
Is there anybody alive out there? I was driving through the misty rain
Yeah searchin' for a mystery train
Boppin' through the wild blue
Tryin' to make a connection with you This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
This is radio nowhere, is there anybody alive out there?
Is there anybody alive out there? I just want to feel some rhythm
I just want to feel some rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm
I just want to feel your rhythm I stood stone-like at midnight, suspended in my masquerade
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Sit down," I stood up
Ooh...growin' up The flag of piracy flew from my mast, my sails were set wing to wing
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate, she couldn't sail but she sure could sing
I pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
I broke all the rules, strafed my old high school, never once gave thought to landing
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd, but when they said, "Come down," I threw up
Ooh...growin' up I took month-long vacations in the stratosphere, and you know it's really hard to hold your breath
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared, I was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
Well, my feet they finally took root in the earth, but I got me a nice little place in the stars
And I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
I hid in the mother breast of the crowd, but when they said, "Pull down," I pulled up
Ooh...growin' up
Ooh...growin' up Can't see nothin' in front of me
Can't see nothin' coming up behind
Make my way through this darkness
I can't feel nothing but this chain that binds me
Lost track of how far I've gone
How far I've gone, how high I've climbed
On my back's a sixty pound stone
On my shoulder a half mile of line Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight Left the house this morning
Bells ringing filled the air
I was wearin' the cross of my calling
On wheels of fire I come rollin' down here Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li There's spirits above and behind me
Faces gone black, eyes burnin' bright
May their precious blood bind me
Lord, as I stand before your fiery light Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li I see you Mary in the garden
In the garden of a thousand sighs
There's holy pictures of our children
Dancin' in a sky filled with light
May I feel your arms around me
May I feel your blood mix with mine
A dream of life comes to me
Like a catfish dancin' on the end of my line Sky of blackness and sorrow (a dream of life)
Sky of love, sky of tears (a dream of life)
Sky of glory and sadness (a dream of life)
Sky of mercy, sky of fear (a dream of life)
Sky of memory and shadow (a dream of life)
Your burnin' wind fills my arms tonight
Sky of longing and emptiness (a dream of life)
Sky of fullness, sky of blessed life Come on up for the rising
Come on up, lay your hands in mine
Come on up for the rising
Come on up for the rising tonight Li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li, li Two, three, four Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field so happy and free?
If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen me
Have you ever seen a one-legged dog making his way down the street?
If you've ever seen a one-legged dog then you've seen me Then you've seen me, I come and stand at every door
Then you've seen me, I always leave with less than I had before
Then you've seen me, bet I can make you smile when the blood, it hits the floor
Tell me, friend, can you ask for anything more?
Tell me can you ask for anything more? Have you ever seen a scarecrow filled with nothing but dust and wheat?
If you've ever seen that scarecrow then you've seen me
Have you ever seen a one-armed man punching at nothing but the breeze?
If you've ever seen a one-armed man then you've seen me Then you've seen me, I come and stand at every door
Then you've seen me, I always leave with less than I had before
Then you've seen me, bet I can make you smile when the blood, it hits the floor
Tell me, friend, can you ask for anything more?
Tell me can you ask for anything more? These things that have comforted me, I drive away
This place that is my home I cannot stay
My only faith's in the broken bones and bruises I display Have you ever seen a one-legged man trying to dance his way free?
If you've ever seen a one-legged man then you've seen me Well now you may think I'm foolish
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret 'bout that
Well come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause baby I got plenty of that
I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Cruising down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac Well now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you, man, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That the flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
But man I ain't going for that
I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
Yeah, it's bigger than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey we can park it out in the back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back
Cruising down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back
Of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where You can't remember
And you can't forget She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away My name is Joe Roberts, I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville, barracks number 8
I always done an honest job, as honest as I could
I got a brother named Franky, and Franky ain't no good Now ever since we was young kids, it's been the same come down
I get a call on the shortwave, Franky's in trouble downtown
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way Yeah me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin', like any brother would
Man turns his back on his family, well he just ain't no good Well Franky went in the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we were gettin' robbed
Franky came home in '68 and me I took this job Yeah we're laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin', teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family, he ain't no friend of mine Well the night was like any other, well I got a call 'bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lyin' on the floor lookin' bad, bleedin' hard from his head
There was a girl cryin' at a table and it was Frank, they said Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights
Well I musta done a hundred and ten through Michigan County that night
It was out at the crossroads, down 'round Willow bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates, behind the wheel was Frank Well I chased him through them county roads
Till a sign said "Canadian border five miles from here"
I pulled over the side of the highway and watched his taillights disappear Me and Franky laughin' and drinkin', nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band played "Night of the Johnstown Flood"
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother would
Man turns his back on his family, he just ain't no good I thought I heard the Captain say,

But I just can't sleep
I got something runnin' around my head
Ooh that just won't keep In the silence I hear my heart beatin'
Time slippin' away
I got a time bomb tickin' deep inside of me
Girl all I want to say I keep searchin' for you darlin'
Searchin everywhere I go
And when I find you there's gonna be just one thing that you gotta know One thing you gotta know My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down
My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down At night I walk the streets lookin' for romance
But I always end up stumblin' in a half trance
I search for a connection in some new eyes
That hardly protect you from too many dreams passed by I see you standin, across the room watchin' me without a sound
I'm gonna push my way through that crowd
I'm gonna tear your holy walls down
Tear all your walls down My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down

My love, love, love, love, love, love, will not let you down Well the street lights shine
Down on Blessing Avenue
Lovers they walk by
Holdin' hands two by two A breeze crosses the porch
Bicycle spokes spin 'round
Jacket's on, I'm out the door
Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by Kid's rubber ball smacks
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light
Big bank clock chimes
Off go the sleepy front porch lights Downtown the store's alive
As the evening's underway
Things been a little tight
But I know they're gonna turn my way And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by Frankie's Diner's
Over on the edge of town
Neon sign spinnin' round
Like a cross over the lost and found Fluorescent lights
Flicker above Bob's Grill
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks "fill?"
And says "penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill" She went away
She cut me like a knife
Hello beautiful thing
Maybe you could save my life In just a glance
Down here on Magic Street
Love's a fool's dance
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by And the girls in their summer clothes
In the cool of the evening light
The girls in their summer clothes
Pass me by La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la la la I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
Saw my reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the streets of Philadelphia I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone,
I heard the voices of friends, vanished and gone,
At night I could hear the blood in my veins,
It was just as black and whispering as the rain,
On the streets of Philadelphia Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
And my clothes don't fit me no more,
A thousand miles
Just to slip this skin Night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake,
I can feel myself fading away,
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss,
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the streets of Philadelphia On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert
I pick up my money and head back into town
Driving 'cross the Waynesboro county line
I got the radio on and I'm just killing time
Working all day in my daddy's garage
Driving all night chasing some mirage
Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge The dogs on Main Street howl
'Cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land I've done my best to live the right way
I get up every morning and go to work each day
But your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold
Sometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode
Explode and tear this whole town apart
Take a knife and cut this pain from my heart
Find somebody itching for something to start The dogs on Main Street howl
'Cause they understand
If I could wrench one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no, I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land Well there's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor
I packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm
Gonna be a twister to blow everything down
That ain't got the faith to stand its ground
Blow away the dreams that tear you apart
Blow away the dreams that break your heart
Blow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted The dogs on Main Street howl
'Cause they understand
If I could take one moment into my hands
Mister I ain't a boy, no I'm a man
And I believe in a promised land And I believe in a promised land
And I believe in a promised land I was born right here on randolph street in freehold
Here right behind that big red maple in freehold
Well, I went to school right here
Got laid and had my first beer
In freehold Well, my folks always lived and worked right here in freehold
I remember running up the street, past the condo to the church here in
Freehold
Chase my daddy down in these bars
First fell in love with this guitar
Here in frehold Well, I had my first kiss at the ymca canteen on a friday night
Maria espenoza tell me where are you tonight?
You were 13 but way ahead of your time
I walked home with a limb but I felt fine
That night in freehold Well, the girls at freehold regional they looked pretty fine
And my heart broke at least half a dozen times
I wonder if they miss me, they still get the itch
Would they have dumped me if they knew I'd strike a bridge?
Straight out of freehold Well, tex, rest in peace, and marion gave us kids a hand in freehold
George and me started up a little rock and roll band in freehold
Well, we learned pretty quick how to rock
I'll never forget the feeling of that first 5 bucks in my pocket
That I earned in freehold Well, I got outta here really hard and fast in freehold
Everybody wanted to kick my ass back there in freehold
Well, if you were different, black or brown
It was a bit of a redneck town
Back then in freehold Well, something broke my daddy's back in freehold
In '69 he left and he never come back to freehold
'cept once he drove from california, 3000 miles in three days
Called my relatives some dirty names
And pulled straight out of freehold My sister had her first little baby at 17 in freehold
Well people they can be pretty mean
Honey, you had a rough road to go, but you ain't made of nothin' but soul
I love you more than you'll ever know
We both survived freehold Well, my buddy mike, well, he's the mayor now in freehold
I remember when we used to have a lot more hair in freehold
Well, I left and swore I'd never walk these streets again, jack
Tonight all I can say is "holy shit, I'm back!"
Back in freehold Well, this summer everything was green in freehold
Rode my kids on the fire engine through the streets of freehold
I showed 'em where their dad was born and raised
And first felt the sun on his face
There in freehold Well, I still got a lot of good friends right here in town
I can usually find me a free beer somewhere
With offers of free meals I am blessed
Should I go crazy, blow all my money and ruin my life, well, at least i'll
Never go hungry I guess
Here in freehold Well, I got a good catholic education here in freehold
Led to an awful lot of masturbation here in freehold
Father, it was just something I did for a smile
Hell, I still get a good one off once in a while
And dedicate it to freehold
Don't get me wrong, I ain't puttin' anybody down
Hell, in the end it all just goes and comes around
It's one hell of a town, freehold! Some need gold and some need diamond rings
Or a drug to take away the pain that living brings
Promise of a better world to come
When whatever here is done
I don't need that sky of blue, babe
All I know since I found you
I'm happy when I'm in your arms
Happy, darling, come the dark
Happy when I taste your kiss
I'm happy in a love like this There's a house upon a distant hill
Where you can hear the laughter of children ring
Guardian angels, they watch from above
Guarding over the love that they bring
But at night I feel the darkness near
And I awake and I find you near
I'm happy with you in my arms
Happy with you in my heart
Happy when I taste your kiss
I'm happy in a love like this In a world of doubt and fear
I wake at night and reach to find you near
Lost in a dream, you caught me as I fell
I want more than just a dream to tell Born in this world, darling, with few days
And trouble never far behind
Man and woman circle each other in a cage
A cage that's been handed down the line
Lost and running 'neath a million dead stars
Tonight let's shed our skins and slip these bars
Happy in each other's arms
Happy baby, come the dark
Happy in each other's kiss
I m happy in a love like this We said we'd walk together baby come what may
That come the twilight should we lose our way
If as we're walking a hand should slip free
I'll wait for you
And should I fall behind
Wait for me We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side
We'd help each other stay in stride
But each lover's steps fall so differently
But I'll wait for you
And if I should fall behind
Wait for me Now everyone dreams of love lasting and true
Oh, but you and I know what this world can do
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see
I'll wait for you
And if I should fall behind
Wait for me Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead
There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me
Darlin' I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me Yeah, I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me
I'll wait for you
Should I fall behind
Wait for me (J.& N. Cassidy) When I was a little kid
I never liked to eat
Mom would put things on my plate
And I'd dump 'em on her feet
But then one day she made this soup
I ate it all in bed
I asked her what she put in it
And this is what she said: "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips
And alligator eyes
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs
And salamander thighs
Rabbit ears and camel rears
And tasty toenail pies
Stir 'em all together
And it's mama's soup surprise" I went into the bathroom
And I stood beside the sink
I said, "I'm feeling slightly ill
And I think I'd like a drink" Mama said, "I've just the thing
I'll get it in a wink
It's full of lots of protein
And vitamins, I think" "Oh, chicken lips and lizard hips
And alligator eyes
Monkey legs and buzzard eggs
And salamander thighs
Rabbit ears and camel rears
And tasty toenail pies
Stir 'em all together
And it's mama's soup surprise" Your Mamma's yappin' in the back seat
Tell her to push over and move them big feet
Every Monday morning I gotta drive her down to the unemployment agency
Well this morning I ain't fighting tell her I give up
Tell her she wins if she'll just shut up
But it's the last time that she's gonna be ridin' with me You can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby you've got me
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' Now there's girls melting on the beach
And they're so fine but so out of reach
'Cause I'm stuck in traffic down here on fifty third street
Now Sherry my love for you is real
But I didn't count on this package deal
And baby this car just ain't big enough for her and me So you can tell her there's a hot sun beatin' on the black top
She keeps talkin' she'll be walkin' that last block
She can take a subway back to the ghetto tonight
Well I got some beer and the highway's free
And I got you, and baby you've got me
Hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin' Well let there be sunlight, let there be rain
Let the brokenhearted love again
Sherry we can run with our arms open wide before the tide
To all the girls down at Sacred Heart
And all you operators back in the park
Say hey, hey, hey what you say Sherry Darlin'
Ho, ho, ho, say, hey, hey, what you say Sherry Darlin', oh come on
Say hey, hey, hey, what you say Sherry Darlin' Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening
To the hours and minutes tickin' away
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin
While it was all just slippin' away
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come
Or that train to come roarin' round the bend
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose
And a woman I can call my friend These are better days baby
Yeah there's better days shining through
These are better days baby
Better days with a girl like you Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt
It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending
A rich man in a poor man's shirt
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon
Your heart like a diamond shone
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms
Out of these hard luck bones These are better days baby
These are better days it true
These are better days
There's better days shining through Now a life of leisure and pirate's treasure
Don't make much for tragedy
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin
And can't stand the company
Every fool's got a reason for feelin' sorry for himself
And turning his heart to stone
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell
And I feel like I'm comin' home These are better days baby
There's better days shining through
These are better days
Better days with a girl like you These are better days baby
These are better days it's true
These are better days
Better days are shining through Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues
In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy, won't you look down over me?
Yeah, I got a first class ticket but I'm as blue as a boy can be Then I'm walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel? Saw the ghost of Elvis on Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for the King
Down in the Jungle Room Then I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel? They've got catfish on the table, they've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer?
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis Now, Muriel plays piano every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would do a little number And I sang with all my might
And she said, Tell me, are you a Christian child?"
And I said "Ma'am, I am tonight" Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel? Walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel? Put on my blue suede shoes and I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta blues
In the middle of the pouring rain Touched down in the land of the Delta blues
In the middle of the pouring rain Well if I could I surely would

O Mary don't Woke up this morning my house was cold
Checked out the furnace she wasn't burnin'
Went out and hoped in my old Ford
Hit the engine but she ain't turnin'
We've given each other some hard lessons lately
But we ain't learnin'
We're the same sad story that's a fact
One step up and two steps back Bird on a wire outside my motel room
But he ain't singin'
Girl in white outside a church in June
But the church bells they ain't ringing
I'm sittin' here in this bar tonight
But all I'm thinkin' is
I'm the same old story same old act
One step up and two steps back It's the same thing night on night
Who's wrong baby who's right
Another fight and I slam the door on
Another battle in our dirty little war
When I look at myself I don't see
The man I wanted to be
Somewhere along the line I slipped off track
I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back There's a girl across the bar
I get the message she's sendin'
Mmm she ain't lookin' to married
And me well honey I'm pretending
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms
The music was never-ending
We danced as the evening sky faded to black
One step up and two steps back Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the darkness falls I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snapping at my heels I broke through the trees and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms I awoke and I imagined, the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed and to that house I did ride
From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story and who I'd come for
She said "I'm sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore" My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling, so cold and alone
Shining 'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned Well you don't like, don't like the way I walk
And you don't like, don't like the way I talk
You criticize about me endlessly
Logic defies how you get stuck with me
And you complain about the clothes I wear
And you explain there's other boys out there
You complain my car makes too much noise
And you cry I'm always out with the boys Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you You complain the way I love you at night
You explain I'm really not your type
If we go out, you say I'm such a bore
If we stay in, you say what are we living for
I don't understand, there's nothing I can do
There ain't no way I can satisfy you
End of the night I lean in for a kiss
Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you, hey!
Hey!
(Come on boys!) Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you I tried to change, I got a job in sales
I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales
And babe I tried to make the latest scene
Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine
I bought a record with all the latest grooves
A book of love with all the latest moves
I bought some flowers and I waited at your door
And you came out, didn't want to see me no more Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling)
Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it's true
Ain't good enough for you
Whoaaa! We played king of the mountain out on the end
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight
I don't even know why, I don't know why I made this call
Or if any of this matters anymore after all But the stars are burnin' bright like some mistery uncovered
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart
My blood brother Do you still say your prayers little darlin'
Do you go to bed at night
Prayin' that tomorrow, everything will be alright
But tomorrow's fall in number
In number one by one
You wake up and you're dying
You don't even know what from Well they shot you point blank
You been shot in the back
Baby point blank you been fooled this time
Little girl that's a fact
Right between the eyes, baby, point blank
Right between the pretty lies that they tell
Little girl you fell You grew up where young girls they grow up fast
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
But what they asked baby wasn't right
You didn't have to live that life
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet
These days you don't wait on Romeos
You wait on that welfare check
And on all the pretty things that you can't ever have
And on all the promises That always end up point blank
Shot between the eyes
Oh, point blank
Like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
You're walkin' in the sights, girl of point blank
And it's one false move and baby the lights go out Once I dreamed we were together again
Baby you and me
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
We were standin' at the bar
It was hard to hear
The band was playin' loud and you were shoutin' somethin' in my ear
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin' slow
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go Well I saw you last night down on the avenue
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you
You were standin' in the doorway out of the rain
You didn't answer when I called out your name
You just turned, and then you looked away
Like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away Point blank
Right between the eyes
Oh, point blank
Right between the pretty lies you fell
Point blank
Shot straight through the heart Yeah point blank
You've been twisted up 'til you've become just another part of it
Point blank, you're walkin' in the sights
Point blank
Livin' one false move just one false move away
Point blank
They caught you in their sights
Point blank
Did you forget how to love
Girl, did you forget how to fight
Point blank
They must have shot you in the head
'Cause point blank
Bang bang baby you're dead Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night
Everything was in place, everything was all right
But you were missing
Missing... Last night I dreamed the sky went black
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back
You were lost and in trouble so far from home
I reached for you, my arms went to stone
I woke and you were missing
Missing... I searched for something to explain
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves
Tell me baby where did you go
You were here just a moment ago There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall
Your smell drifts through our bedroom
I wake, but I don't move With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill
With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
Whoa-oh, she's the one
She's the one That thunder in your heart at night when you're kneeling in the dark,
it say's you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies
and all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
Whoa-oh, she's the one
She's the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she's fill them long summer nights with her tenderness
That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one
Oh, she's the one In my dreams our love was lost.
I lived by luck and faith.
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late.
Now i'm standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind.
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
Back in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star.
But these promises we make at night, oh that's all they are.
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as a howlin' wind.
And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again..
Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
Back in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness.
I met you with indifference, and I don't know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world.
Where all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls.
And all the love I've thrown away and lost, I'm longing for again.
Now darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
Back in your arms, back in your arms again.
Back in your arms Every day here you come walking
I hold my tongue, I don't do much talking
You say you're happy and you're doin' fine
Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie Well for a while I've been watching you steady
Ain't gonna move 'til you're good and ready
You show up and then you shy away
But I know pretty soon you'll be walkin' this way
Sad eyes never lie
Sad eyes never lie Baby don't you know I don't care
Don't you know that I've been there
Well if something in the air feels a little unkind
Don't worry darling, it'll slip your mind I know you think you'd never be mine
Well that's okay, baby, I don't mind
That shy smile's sweet, that's a fact
Go ahead, I don't mind the act
Here you come all dressed up for a date
Well one more step and it'll be too late
Blue blue ribbon in your hair
Like you're so sure I'll be standing here I've got a mule and her name is Sal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
She's a good old worker and a good old pal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
We haul'd some barges in our day
Filled with lumber, coal and hay
We know every inch of the way
From Albany to Bufallo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
You'll always know your neighbour
And you'll always know your pal
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal We'd better look around for a job, old gal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
You can bet your life I'll never part Sal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal Get up mule, here comes a lock
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock
One more trip and we'll go
Right back home to Buffalo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
You'll always know your neighbour
And you'll always know your pal
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Where would I be if I lost my pal?
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
I'd like to see a mule as good as my Sal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal A friend of mine once got her sore
Now he's got a broken jaw
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe
And kicked him back to Bufallo Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
You'll always know your neighbour
And you'll always know your pal
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Low bridge, we're coming to a town
You'll always know your neighbour
And you'll always know your pal
If ya made your livin' on the Erie Canal Low bridge, ev'rybody down
Low bridge, we're coming to a town You got your book baby with all your fears
Let me honey and I'll catch your tears
I'll take your sorrow if you want me to
Come tomorrow
That's what I'll do
Listen to me Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart Well you say you got no new dreams to touch
You feel like a stranger babe who knows too much
You come home late and get undressed
You lie in bed and feel this emptiness
Well listen to me Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart Well every river, baby, it runs dry
Until the sun's torn from the sky
Till every feel you've felt burst free
Gone tumblin' down into the sea Listen to me
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart
Janey don't you lose heart Crazy Janey and her mission man
Were back in the alley tradin' hands
'Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-Man
All duded up for Saturday night
Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
And said, "Anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rosé so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're build like light
And they dance like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand up right now and let them shoot through you Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "Trust some of this, it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you really feel it"
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake
I said, I'm hurt, she said, honey, let me heal it
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right, like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice
Just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Janey don't know what she do to you
Spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and his shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt
Singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row
Felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night) Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirit in the night (all night), all night (all night)
Oh, stand right up and let her shoot through you
Like a spirit in the night (all night), all night (all night)
All night (all night), all night (all night), all night (all night), all night (all night)
All night
All night You and me we were the pretenders
We let it all slip away
In the end what you don't surrender
Well the world just strips away Girl, ain't no kindness in the face of strangers
Ain't gonna find no miracles here
Well you can wait on your blesses my darlin'
I got a deal for you right here I ain't lookin' for praise or pity
I ain't comin' 'round searchin' for a crutch
I just want someone to talk to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch Ain't no mercy on the streets of this town
Ain't no bread from heavenly skies
Ain't nobody drawin' wine from this blood
It's just you and me tonight Tell me, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much
I just want something to hold on to
And a little of that human touch
Just a little of that human touch Oh girl that feeling of safety you prize
Well it comes at a hard hard price
You can't shut off the risk and the pain
Without losin' the love that remains
We're all riders on this train So you've been broken and you've been hurt
Show me somebody who ain't
Yeah, I know I ain't nobody's bargain
But, hell, a little touch up
And a little paint You might need somethin' to hold on to
When all the answers, they don't amount to much
Somebody that you could just to talk to
And a little of that human touch Baby, in a world without pity
Do you think what I'm askin's too much
I just want to feel you in my arms
Share a little of that human touch
Share a little of that human touch
Feel a little of that human touch
Feel a little of that human touch
Share a little of that human touch
Feel a little of that human touch
Give you a little of that human touch
Give me a little of that human touch Tonight down on union street
I'm thinkin' back, baby, to you and me
To the way you used to be
And your words come back to me
From passing cars
Their voices sing out
In empty bars where guitars ring out
We'd be the lucky one to get out You said, none baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
Oh strong enough to save something
From what they gave
None baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave Now in dreams these nights I see you my friend
The way you were back then
Ah, on a night like this
I know that girl no longer exists
Except for a moment in some stranger's eyes
Or in a nameless girl
In cars rushin' by
That's where I find you tonight
And in my heart it still survives
To none, baby, but the brave
No one baby but the brave Oh strong enough to save
Something from the love they gave
Yeah, none baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
Now tonight once more I search
Every face on that crowded floor
Looking for I don't know what for
Something that ain't there no more
There's a girl standin' by the band
She reminds me of you
And I asked her to danceas the drummer counts his play
I take her hand and we move away And tonight, now I'll see old friends
Caught in things they got no chance to win
Just gettin' beaten, and then playin' again
'till their strength gives out
Or their hearts give in
Who's that man who thinks
He can decide whose dreams will live
And who(se) shall be pushed aside
Did he ever walk down this streets at night
And looked into the eyes
Baby, of none, baby, but the brave No one baby but the brave
No, none baby but the brave
No one baby but the brave
No one baby,no one but the brave Cynthia, when you come walkin' by
You're an inspirin' sight
Cynthia, you don't smile or say "hi"
But baby that's alright
'cause I don't need to hold you
Or taste your kiss
I just like knowin' cynthia, you exist at all
In a world like this
Cynthia, when you pass it seems
Like this whole town drops
Cynthia, maybe it's just me babe
Some fool stuck here watchin' the clock
Well, you give us a reason to start whisper "why"
To stop singin', baby, and salute your style
Yeah cynthia Well now you ain't the finest thing I'll never have
And when you go the hurt you leave
Well, baby, it ain't so bad
No it ain't cynthia
Yeah there ain't a man in this whole town
Who'll say you ain't fine
D'you hear them guys talkin'
Tell me, baby, do you mind
Well you make us happy, honey, when we feel sad
To see sump'n'so good, in a world gone bad
There's still cynthia, oh yeah Cynthia, no one knows your number
No one knows where you live
Cynthia, I wonder do you understand
This strange thing you give
Yeah, well baby, is it your style
The mystery in your smile
Or just how cool you walk
In a world gone wild
Ah tell me if you will, cynthia
Well I gotta be pretty naive to believe in you
I know you ain't ever gonna be my dream come true
That's alright, I gotta dream
That's as good as you, cynthia
Oh now baby, this ain't no come-on
It's a walk on, walk on
Oh that's right, oh yeah
Mmmm, you make me holier
Yeah, yeah, alright
I said yeah, yeah, alright
Well she's a yeah, yeah, alright
I said yeah, yeah, alright
Well it's a yeah, yeah, alright
Well she's a yeah, yeah, alright
I said yeah, yeah, alright I'm driving in my car
I turn on the radio
I'm pulling you close
You just say no
You say you don't like it
But girl I know you're a liar
'Cause when we kiss
Ooh, fire But late at night
I'm takin' you home
I say I wanna stay
You say you wanna be alone
You say you don't love me
But you can't hide your desire
When we kiss
Ooh, fire You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Well your kisses they burn
But your heart stays cool Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they didn't deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Mmh, fire
Fire You had a hold on me
Right from the start
A grip so tight
I couldn't tear it apart
My nerves all jumpin'
Actin' like a fool
Well your kisses they burn
But your heart stays cool Romeo and Juliet
Samson and Delilah
You can bet
Their love they didn't deny
Your words say split
But your words they lie
When we kiss
Mmh, fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire Well, we bursted out of class
Had to get away from those fools
We learned more from a three-minute record, baby
Than we ever learned in school
Tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart begin to pound
You say you're tired and you just want to close your eyes
And follow your dreams down Well, we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Like soldiers in the winter's night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender Well, now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Now I'm ready to grow young again
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers in the stormy night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim
The walls of my room are closing in
There's a war outside still raging
You say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath
Peaceful skies in my lover's bed
With a wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers in a stormy night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
No retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio
Back in eighteen-o-three
James and Danny Heaton
Found the ore that was linin' yellow creek
They built a blast furnace
Here along the shore
And they made the cannon balls
That helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown
Here in Youngstown
My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces
Kept 'em hotter than hell
I come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer
A job that'd suit the devil as well
Taconite, coke and limestone
Fed my children and made my pay
Then smokestacks reachin' like the arms of god
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay Here in Youngstown
Here in Youngstown
My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy come on the 0hio works
When he come home from world war two
Now the yards just scrap and rubble
He said, "Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do"
These mills they built the tanks and bombs
That won this country's wars
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam
Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for Here in Youngstown
Here in Youngstown
My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down
Here darlin' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley
To the Mesabi iron range
To the coal mines of Appalacchia
The story's always the same
Seven-hundred tons of metal a day
Now sir you tell me the world's changed
Once I made you rich enough
Rich enough to forget my name In Youngstown
In Youngstown
My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down
Here darlin' in Youngstown When I die I don't want no part of heaven
I would not do heavens work well
I pray the devil comes and takes me
To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming
In Harlem late last night
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine
Over the Jersey state line
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants
Together they take a stab at romance
And disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows
Always quiet, holding hands
From the churches to the jails
Tonight all is silence in the world
As we take our stand
Down in Jungleland The midnight gang's assembled
And picked a rendezvous for the night
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign
That brings this fair city light
Man, there's an opera out on the Turnpike
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley
Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night
The street's alive as secret debts are paid
Contacts made, they flash unseen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades
Hustling for the record machine
The hungry and the hunted
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands
That face off against each other out in the street
Down in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing
To the records that the DJ plays
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
Desperate as the night moves on
Just one look and a whisper, and they're gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat
Soul engines running through a night so tender
In a bedroom locked in whispers
Of soft refusal and then surrender
In the tunnels uptown, the Rat's own dream guns him down
As shots echo down them hallways in the night
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all
They just stand back and let it all be
And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment
And try to make an honest stand
But they wind up wounded, not even dead
Tonight in Jungleland I've been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline
To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you
A kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night
Prove it all night
Girl there's nothing else that we can do
So prove it all night
Prove it all night
And girl I'll prove it all night for you Everybody's got a hunger, a hunger they can't resist
There's so much that you want, you deserve much more than this
But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn't that be nice
But this ain't no dream we're living through tonight
Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night
Prove it all night
Prove it all night girl and call the bluff
We'll prove it all night
Prove it all night
Girl I'll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow
Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo
You hear their voices telling you not to go
They've made their choices and they'll never know
What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie
What it's like to live and die Prove it all night
Prove it all night
Girl there's nothing else that we can do
So prove it all night
Prove it all night
And girl I'll prove it all night for you I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night
I'll prove it all night Spread out now Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama's reins
You know playin' blind man's bluff is a little baby's game
You pick up little dynamite, I'll pick up little gun
And together we're gonna go out tonight and make that highway run
You don't have to call me lieutenant, Rosie, and I don't want to be your son
The only lover I'm ever gonna need's your soft, sweet, little girl's tongue
And Rosie, you're the one Dynamite's in the belfry, baby, playin' with the bats
Little gun's downtown in front of Woolworth's tryin' out his attitude on all the cats
Papa's on the corner, waitin' for the bus
Mama, she's home in the window, waitin' up for us
She'll be there in that chair when they wrestle her upstairs, 'cause you know we ain't gonna come
I ain't here on business, baby, I'm only here for fun
And Rosie, you're the one Rosalita, jump a little higher
Senorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire Jack the Rabbit and Weak Knee Willie, don't you know they're gonna be there
Ah Sloppy Sue and Big Bone Billy, they'll be coming up for air
We're gonna play some pool, skip some school
Act real cool, stay out all night, it's gonna feel alright
So Rosie, come out tonight, little baby, come out tonight
Windows are for cheaters, chimneys for the poor
Oh, closets are for hangers, winners use the door
So use it, Rosie, that's what it's there for Rosalita, jump a little higher
Senorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire, alright Now, I know your mama, she don't like me, 'cause I play in a rock and roll band
And I know your daddy, he don't dig me, but he never did understand
Your papa lowered the boom, he locked you in your room, I'm comin' to lend a hand
I'm comin' to liberate you, confiscate you, I want to be your man
Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem funny
But now you're sad, your mama's mad
And your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Oh, your papa says he knows that I don't have any money
Oh, so your daddy says he knows that I don't have any money
Well, tell him this is his last chance to get his daughter in a fine romance
Because a record company, Rosie, just gave me a big advance And my tires were slashed and I almost crashed, but the Lord had mercy
And my machine, she's a dud, out stuck in the mud somewhere in the swamps of Jersey
Well, hold on tight, stay up all night, 'cause Rosie, I'm comin' on strong
By the time we meet the morning light, I will hold you in my arms
I know a pretty little place in Southern California, down San Diego way
There's a little cafe, where they play guitars all night and all day
You can hear them in the back room strummin'
So hold tight, baby, 'cause don't you know daddy's comin'
Everybody sing Rosalita, jump a little higher
Senorita, come sit by my fire
I just want to be your lover, ain't no liar
Rosalita, you're my stone desire Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down
He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town
He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar
He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark
Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house
She checked herself out in the dining room mirror
And undid an extra button on her blouse
He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am
He was staring at the ceiling
He couldn't move his hands [Chorus]
Oh mama mama mama come quick
I've got the shakes and I'm gonna be sick
Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night
Hey now mama don't shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light
Don't you shut out the light Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said "Johnny Welcome Home"
Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome
His mama said "Johnny oh Johnny, I'm so glad to have you back with me"
His pa said he was sure they'd give him his job back down at the factory [Chorus] Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain
Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there's a river without a name
In the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands
He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he's been [Chorus] I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey, some misty years ago
Through the mud and the beer, and the blood and the cheers, I've seen champions come and go
So if you got the guts mister, yeah if you've got the balls
If you think it's your time, then step to the line, and bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you've got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you've got
Bring on your wrecking ball Now my home was here in the Meadowlands, where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes
Here where the blood is spilled, the arena's filled, and Giants play the game
So raise up your glasses and let me hear your voices call
Come on!
Because tonight all the dead are here, so bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Take your best shot, let me see what you've got
Bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! Yeah we know that come tomorrow, none of this will be here
So hold tight on your anger
Hold tight on your anger
Hold tight to your anger, and don't fall to your fear Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust
And all our youth and beauty, it's been given to the dust
And your game has been decided, and you're burning the clock down
And all our little victories and glories, have turned into parking lots
When your best hopes and desires, are scattered through the wind
And hard times come, hard times go
Hard times come, hard times go
And hard times come, hard times go
Hard times come, hard times go
Hard times come, hard times go
Yeah just to come again Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you've got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball)
Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball)
Take your best shot, let me see what you've got, bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! We met out on open streets
When we had no place to go
I remember how my heart beat
When you said "i love you so"
Then little by little
We choked out all the life that out love could hold
No, no It was like we held a noose
And baby without check
We pulled it a little tighter around our necks
Each one waiting for the other
Darling to say when
Now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end We didn't count tomorrows
We took what we had and baby we ran
There was no place for sorrow
Every place we went I held your hand
And when the night closed in
I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know
But oh no It was like we held a noose
And baby without check
We pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
Each one waiting for the other
Darling to say when
Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end Our love has fallen around us
Like we said it never would
We saw it happen to all the others
But to us it never would
Well how could something so bad, darling
Come from something that was so good
I don't know But it was like we held a noose
And baby without check
We pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks
Each one waiting for the other
Darling to say when
Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end On a loose end There's a pale horse comin'
I'm gonna ride it
I'll rise in the morning
My fate decided
I'm a dead man walkin'
I'm a dead man walkin' In St. James Parish
I was born and christened
Now I've got my story
Mister no need for you to listen
It's just a dead man talkin' Once I had a job I had a girl
But between our dreams and actions
Lies this world In the deep forest
Their blood and tears rushed over me
All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun
And my fear up inside of me
Like a dead man talkin' 'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black
Sister I won't ask for forgiveness
My sins are all I have Now the clouds above my prison
Move slowly across the sky
There's a new day comin'
And my dreams are full tonight I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown
This is your hometown In '65 tension was running high at my high school
There was a lot of fights between the black and white
There was nothing you could do
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
Words were passed in a shotgun blast
Troubled times had come
To my hometown
My hometown
My hometown
My hometown Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back
To your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown
Your hometown Last night me and Kate we laid in bed
Talking about getting out
Packing up our bags maybe heading south
I'm thirty five we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around
This is your hometown Tear drops on the city, Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can't find the room to move
Well, everybody better move over, that's all
'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out Well, I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner, things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
(And kid, you better get the picture)
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city, all the little pretties raise their hands
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half
With the Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth
Oh, nothing but a Tenth
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth
I'm talking bout a Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth
Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, I'm talking 'bout a
Tenth Avenue freeze-out... The times are tough now, just getting tougher
This whole world is rough, it's just getting rougher
Cover me, come on baby, cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Now promise me baby you won't let them find us
Hold me in your arms, let's let our love blind us
Cover me, shut the door and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough I don't wanna see any more,
Cover me, come on in and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
Turn out the light, bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more This whole world is out there just trying to score
I've seen enough I ain't gonna see any more,
Cover me, wrap you arms around and cover me
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Ah looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me
Yeah I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me In Candy's room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall
But to get to Candy's room you gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall
Strangers from the city, call my baby's number and they bring her toys
When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I want to be Candy's boy There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face
A sadness all her own
From which no man can keep Candy safe We kiss, my heart's pumpin' to my brain
And the blood rushes in my veins, the fire rushes towards the skies
I go driving, driving deep into the night
I go driving deep into the light, in Candy's eyes She says, baby if you want to be wild
You got a lot to learn, close your eyes
Let them melt, let them fire
Let them burn
'Cause in the darkness, there'll be hidden worlds that shine
When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings
She has men who give her anything she wants, but they don't see
That what she wants is me Oh, and I want her so
I'll never let her go, no, no, no
She knows that I'd give
All that I got to give
All that I want, all that I live
To make Candy mine
Tonight She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car
To go drivin' round
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where You can't remember
And you can't forget She'll lead you down a path
There'll be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
She'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
And you try so hard to see
The way things were when we were at your place
Everyday was just you and me
And you cry because things ain't like before
Well, don't you know it can't be that way anymore
But don't worry baby
'cause I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone If there was something, baby,
That I could do,
Something that would last, honey, I would
But you should know better than to think that you
Can return to the past
So close your eyes and I'll be there
Hold you once more and not go anywhere
I wish I could babe
But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast
And you cry because nothing good ever lasts
Well, I know babe
But I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone
I can't talk now, I'm not alone
So put your ear close to the phone
'cause this is the last dance, the last chance
For hearts of stone I went out walking the other day
Seen a little girl crying along the way
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again
Some day your crying girl will end
And you'll find once again Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes
But I was living in a world of childish dreams
Someday these childish dreams must end
To become a man and grow up to dream again
I believe in the end Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned
For you to roam empty-hearted through this land
Though the world turns you hard and cold
There's one thing mister, that I know
That's if you think your heart is stone
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind
That's why I'll keep searching 'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one Oh, two hearts are better than one
Two hearts girl get the job done
Two hearts are better than one Woah [Verse 1]
They come from everywhere
A longing to be free
They come to join us here
From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream
As people always will
To be safe and warm
In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door
Instead of opening the gate
Aw, let's turn this thing around
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great [Verse 2]
Don't tell me a lie
And sell it as a fact
I've been down that road before
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me
That you never read a book
I never put my faith
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path
And tempt the hands of fate
Aw, let's turn this thing around
Before it gets too late [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great In the quiet of the night
I lie here wide awake
And I ask myself
Is there a difference I can make? [Chorus]
It's up to me and you
Love can conquer hate
I know this to be true
That's what makes us great
