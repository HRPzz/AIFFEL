Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam Yesterday I got a letter from my friend
Fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time it'll be up some time in June
Don't forget, he said to tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips as sweet as cherries And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
Don't be alarmed, she told me the telegram said
But mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Somebody please stop that war now It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
Don't be alarmed, she told me the telegram said
Oh, but mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Somebody please stop it Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
What I'm saying now somebody stop that war Oh yeah, oh yeah
Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord
They know not what they've done 'Cause as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all Ooh, yeah, oh yeah, woah yeah ooh And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all
Ooh the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, one and all Yeah, the harder they come
The harder they'll fall one and all
What I say now what I say now, ooh
What I say now what I say
One time, the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
Wanna know
Ooh the harder they come
The harder they'll fall, wanna know Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well I guess, I have to try Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin, I'm playing for time
There are times I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover If you ever awake
In the mirror of a bad dream And for a fraction of a second,
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memories
Upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star I believe the light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever
(forever)
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary
Hidin' under your bed
I'm gonna
Stand guard
Like the postcard
Of the golden retriever
And never leave
'Til I leave you
With a sweet dream in your head I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two
Ooh ooh
There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you Trust your intuition
It's just like going fishin'
You cast your line and
Hope you get a bite But you don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the marketplace
Trying to help the human race
Struggling to survive
It's as harsh as night I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two
Ooh ooh
There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two
Ooh ooh
There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo-opportunity
I want a shot at redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger Bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well-lit door
Mr. Beerbelly Beerbelly
Get these mutts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff amusing anymore If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
Who'll be my role-model
Now that my role-model is
Gone Gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the Third World
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound
The sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen! and Hallelujah! If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me
You can call me Al
Call me Al No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again But I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away When the mama pajama rolled out a bed
She ran to the police station
When the papa found out he began to shout And he started the investigation
It's against the law
It was against the law
What the mama saw
It was against the law The mama look down and spit on the ground
Every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy,
I'm gonna stick him the house of detention"
Well I'm on my way
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the school yard
Me and Julio down by the school yard In a couple of days they come and
Take me away
But the press let the story leak
And when the radical priest
Come to get me released
We was all on the cover of Newsweek Yeah I'm on my way now
I don't know where I'm going
I'm on my way now, I'm taking my time
But I don't know where
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona
See you, me and Julio
Down by the school yard
See you me and Julio
Down by the school yard
See you me and Julio
Down by the school yard When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder
I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match
My sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover She said it's really not my habit to intrude
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain
About the fifty ways She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover
Fifty ways to leave your lover You just slip out the back, Jack
Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy
Just get yourself free
Hop on the bus, Gus
You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free A winter's day
In a deep and dark
December,
I am alone,
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I've built walls,
A fortress deep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock,
I am an island. Don't talk of love,
But I've heard the words before;
It's sleeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.
I am a rock,
I am an island. I have my books
And my poetry to protect me,
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I am a rock,
I am an island. And a rock feels no pain,
And an island never cries. The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a man
He came from my home town
He wore his passion for his woman
Like a thorny crown
He said Dolores
I live in fear
My love for you's so overpowering
I'm afraid that I will disappear Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a woman
Became a wife
These are the very words she uses
To describe her life
She said a good day
Ain't got no rain
She said a bad day's when I lie in bed
And think of things that might have been Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away I know a father
He had a son
He longed to tell him all the reasons
For the things he'd done
He came a long way
Just to explain
He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping
Then he turned around and headed home again Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away God only knows
God makes his plans
The information's unavailable
To the mortal man
We work our jobs
Collect our pay
Believe we're gliding down the highway
When in fact we're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away Slip slidin' away
You know the nearer your destination
The more you're slip slidin' away When I was a little boy
And the Devil would call my name
I'd say "now who do
Who do you think you're fooling?"
I'm a consecrated boy
Singer in a Sunday choir
My mama loves, she loves me
She gets down on her knees and hugs me
She loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And she loves me
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me When I was grown to be a man
And the Devil would call my name
I'd say "now who do
Who do you think you're fooling?"
I'm a consummated man
I can snatch a little purity
My mama loves me, she loves me
She gets down on her knees and hugs me
She loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And she loves me
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me If I was President
And the Congress call my name
I'd say "who do
Who do you think you're fooling?"
I've got the Presidential Seal
I'm up on the Presidential Podium
My mama loves me
She loves me
She gets down on her knees and hugs me
And she loves me like a rock
She rocks me like the rock of ages
And she loves me
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me Blues Run the Game Lyrics
Written by Jackson C.Frank Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game. Send out for whisky, baby,
Send out for gin,
Me and room service, honey,
Me and room service, babe,
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin When I ain't drinking, baby,
You are on my mind,
When I ain't sleeping, honey,
When I ain't sleeping, Mama,
When I ain't sleeping
Well you know you'll find me crying. Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues have run the game. Living is a gamble, baby,
Loving's much the same,
Wherever I have played,
Wherever I throw those dice,
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game. Maybe when I'm older, baby,
Someplace down the line,
I'll wake up older,
So much older, Mama,
Wake up older
And I'll just stop all my trying. Catch a boat to England, baby,
Maybe to Spain,
Wherever I have gone,
Wherever I've been and gone,
Wherever I have gone
The blues, they're all the same. The first thing I remember
I was lying in my bed
I couldn't of been no more
Than one or two
I remember there's a radio
Comin' from the room next door
And my mother laughed
The way some ladies do
When it's late in the evening
And the music's seeping through The next thing I remember
I am walking down the street
I'm feeling all right
I'm with my boys
I'm with my troops, yeah
And down along the avenue
Some guys were shooting pool
And I heard the sound
Of a cappella groups, yeah
Singing late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar
I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J"
And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening
And I blew that room away The first thing I remember
When you came into my life
I said I'm gonna get that girl
No matter what I do
Well I guess I'd been in love before
And once or twice I been on the floor
But I never loved no one
The way that I loved you
And it was late in the evening
And all the music seeping through Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia
Up in my bedroom (making love)
I got up to wash my face
When I come back to bed
Someone's taken my place Celia, you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh, Cecilia, I'm down on my knees
I'm begging you please to come home
Come on home Jubilation,
She loves me again,
I fall on the floor and I laughing, Jubilation,
She loves me again,
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing After I died, and the makeup had dried
I went back to my place
No moon that night
But a heavenly light shone on my face Still I thought it was odd
There was no sign of God just to usher me in
Then a voice from above
Sugar coated with love, said, "Let us begin" You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line Okay, a new kid in school
Got to follow the rule
You got to learn the routine
Woah, there's a girl over there
With the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen I said, "Hey, what you say?
It's a glorious day,
By the way how long you been dead?"
Maybe you, maybe me
Maybe baby makes three
But she just shook her head You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat
Had to stand in the line
Just to glimpse the divine
What you think about that? Well it seems like our fate to suffer
And wait for the knowledge we seek
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line
No one here, likes a sneak You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line
You got to fill out a form first
And then you wait in the line After you climb, up the ladder of time
The Lord God is here
Face to face, in the vastness of space
Your words disappear And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,
And the current is strong
But all that remains when you
Try to explain is a fragment of song Lord is it, be bop a lu la
Or ooh poppa do
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do
Be bop a lu la It was a slow day
And the sun was beating
On the soldiers by the side of the road
There was a bright light
A shattering of shop windows
The bomb in the baby carriage
Was wired to the radio These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry
Don't cry It was a dry wind
And it swept across the desert
And it curled into the circle of birth
And the dead sand
Falling on the children
The mothers and the fathers
And the automatic earth These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry
Don't cry It's a turn-around jump shot
It's everybody jump start
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
Medicine is magical and magical is art
The boy in the bubble
And the baby with the baboon heart And I believe
These are the days of lasers in the jungle
Lasers in the jungle somewhere
Staccato signals of constant information
A loose affiliation of millionaires
And billionaires and baby These are the days of miracle and wonder
This is the long distance call
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
The way we look to us all, oh yeah The way we look to a distant constellation
That's dying in a corner of the sky
These are the days of miracle and wonder
And don't cry baby, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry Many's the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and often felt forsaken
And certainly misused
But I'm all right, I'm all right
I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be
Bright and bon vivant
So far away from home, so far away from home And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
or driven to its knees
But it's all right, it's all right
We've lived so well so long
Still, when I think of the road
we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong And I dreamed I was dying
And I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
And high up above my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty
Sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
We come on the ship that sailed the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hour
and sing an American tune
But it's all right, it's all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest
That's all I'm trying to get some rest Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends
A newspaper blowin' through the grass
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends Old friends, winter companions, the old men
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sun
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly
How terribly strange to be seventy Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears Well I'm accustomed to a smooth ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep through the night
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie
But I say why
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child? And in remembering a road sign
I am remembering a girl when I was young
And we said these songs are true
These days are ours
These tears are free
And hey
The cross is in the ballpark
The cross is in the ballpark We had a lot of fun
We had a lot of money
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny
Sonny gets married and moves away
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay
Sonny gets sunnier
Day by day by day by day I've been waking up at sunrise
I've been following the light across my room
I watch the night receive the room of my day
Some people say the sky is just the sky
But I say
Why deny the obvious child?
Why deny the obvious child? Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself
How it's strange that some roots are like cages
Sonny's yearbook from high school
Is down on the shelf
And he idle thumbs through the pages
Some have died
Some have fled from themselves
Or struggled from here to get there
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more
I don't expect to sleep the night
Some people say a lie is just a lie
But I say
The cross is in the ballpark
Why deny the obvious child? I hear the drizzle of the rain
Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls. And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets
To England where my heart lies. My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day. And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme. And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you. And as I watch the drops of rain
Weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I I met my old lover
On the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me
I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh Still crazy after all these years I'm not the kind of man
Who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on
Old familiar ways
And I ain't no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy after all these years Four in the morning
Crapped out
Yawning
Longing my life away
I'll never worry
Why should I?
It's all gonna fade Now I sit by my window
And I watch the cars
I fear I'll do some damage
One fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers
Still crazy after all these years
Oh still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off to look for America
Cathy, I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
I've gone to look for America Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said, be careful, his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery
She read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field Cathy, I'm lost, I said though I knew she was sleeping
And I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
They've all come to look for America
All come to look for America
All come to look for America I was reading a magazine
And thinking of a rock and roll song
The year was 1954
And I hadn't been playing that long When a man came on the radio
And this is what he said
He said I hate to break it to his fans
But Johnny Ace is dead, yeah, yeah, yeah Well, I really wasn't
Such a Johnny Ace fan
But I felt bad all the same
So I sent away for his photograph And I waited till it came
It came all the way from Texas
With a sad and simple face
And they signed it on the bottom
From the Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah It was the year of The Beatles
It was the year of The Stones
It was nineteen 1964
I was living in London
With the girl from the summer before It was the year of The Beatles
It was the year of The Stones
A year after J.F.K.
We were staying up all night And giving the days away
And the music was flowing amazing
And blowing my way On a cold December evening
I was walking through the Christmas tide
When a stranger came up and asked me
If I'd heard John Lennon had died And the two of us went to this bar
And we stayed to close the place
And every song we played
Was for The Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah Yesterday it was my birthday
I hung one more year on the line
I should be depressed
My life's a mess
But I'm having a good time I've been loving and loving
And loving
I'm exhausted from loving so well
I should go to bed
But a voice in my head
Says â??Ah, What the hellâ?? Have a good time Paranoia strikes deep in the heartland
But I think it's all overdone
Exaggerating this exaggerating that
They don't have no fun I don't believe what I read in the papers
They're just out to capture my dime
I ain't worrying
And I ain't scurrying
I'm having a good time Have a good time Maybe I'm laughing my way to disaster
Maybe my race has been run
Maybe I'm blind
To the fate of mankind
But what can be done? So God bless the goods we was given
And God bless the U. S. of A.
And God bless the standard of livin'
Let's keep it that way
And we'll all have a good time Have a good time Slow down, you move too fast.
You got to make the morning last.
Just kicking down the cobble stones.
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy. Hello lamppost, What cha knowing?
I've come to watch your flowers growing.
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' groovy. Got no deeds to do, No promises to keep.
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.
Let the morning time drop all its petals on me.
Life, I love you, All is groovy. Time, time
Time, see what's become of me
While I looked around for my possibilities I was so hard to please
Look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hear the Salvation Army band
Down by the riverside's
Bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter Hang on to your hopes, my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should pass away
Simply pretend that you can build them again Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the spring time of my life Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time? Funny how my memory skips
Looking over manuscripts
Of unpublished rhyme Drinking my vodka and lime
I look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is a hazy shade of winter April come she will
When streams are ripe and swelled with rain
May she will stay
Resting in my arms again
June she'll change her tune
In restless walks she'll prowl the night
July she will fly
And give no warning to her flight
August die she must
The autumn winds blow chilly and cold
September I remember
A love once new has now grown old Couple in the next room bound to win a prize
They've been going at it all night long
Well, I'm tryin' to get some sleep
But these motel walls are cheap
Lincoln Duncan is my name
And here's my song, here's my song My father was a fisherman
My mama was a fisherman's friend
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
So when I reached my prime
I left my home in the Maritimes
Headed down the turnpike for New England, sweet New England Holes in my confidence
Holes in the knees of my jeans
I was left without a penny in my pocket
Ooh-oowee, I was about as destituted as a kid could be
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it
I'd like to hock it A young girl in a parkin' lot
Was preaching to a crowd
Singing sacred songs and reading from the Bible
Well, I told her I was lost
And she told all about the Pentecost
And I seen that girl as the road to my survival I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know Just later on the very same night
When I crept to her tent with a flashlight
And my long years of innocence ended
Well, she took me to the woods
Sayin' "Here comes something, and it feels so good!"
And just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended Oh, oh, what a night
Oh, what a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was playing my guitar
Lyin' underneath the stars
Just thankin' the Lord
For my fingers
For my fingers I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know When you're weary, feeling small,
When tears are in your eyes, i will dry them all;
I'm on your side. when times get rough
And friends just can't be found,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
When you're down and out,
When you're on the street,
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you.
I'll take your part.
When darkness comes
And pains is all around,
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down. Sail on silvergirl,
Sail on by.
Your time has come to shine.
All your dreams are on their way.
See how they shine.
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind.
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind. She looked me over
And I guess she thought
I was all right
All right in a sort of a limited way
For an off-night
She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I
To blow against the wind
I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head She said there's something about you
That really reminds me of money
She is the kind of a girl
Who could say things that
Weren't that funny
I said what does that mean
I really remind you of money
She said who am I
To blow against the wind I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head She moved so easily
All I could think of was sunlight
I said aren't you the women
Who was recently given a Fulbright
She said don't I know you
From the cinematographer's party
I said who am I
To blow against the wind I know what I know
I'll sing what I said
We come and we go
That's a thing that I keep
In the back of my head I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told,
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest When I left my home and my family,
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station,
Running scared,
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places
Only they would know Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job,
But I get no offers,
Just a come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue
I do declare,
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, le le le le le le le Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone,
Going home
Where the New York City winters
Aren't bleeding me,
Leading me,
Going home In the clearing stands a boxer,
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame,
"I am leaving, I am leaving"
But the fighter still remains, mmm mmm Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la lie lie
Lie la lie, lie la la la la lie la la lie Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools" said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed its warning,
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo)
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey) On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'
A little boy lies asleep in the earth
While down in the valley a cruel war rages
And people forget what a child's life is worth On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps
And waters the grave with its silent tears
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun
That ended a life at the age of seven years And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'
And generals order their men to kill
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill Joseph's face was black as night
The pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
His path was marked
By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere
And he walked his days
Under African skies This is the story of how we begin to remember
This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out
These are the roots of rhythm
And the roots of rhythm remain In early memory
Mission music
Was ringing 'round my nursery door
I said take this child, Lord
From Tucson Arizona
Give her the wings to fly through harmony
And she won't bother you no more This is the story of how we begin to remember
This is the powerful pulsing of love in the vein
After the dream of falling and calling your name out
These are the roots of rhythm
And the roots of rhythm remain Joseph's face was as black as the night
And the pale yellow moon shone in his eyes
His path was marked
By the stars in the Southern Hemisphere
And he walked the length of his days
Under African skies Little sleepy boy
Do you know what time it is?
Well the hour of your bedtime's
Long been past
And though I know you're fighting it
I can tell when you rub your eyes
You're fading fast
Fading fast Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
Roll across the skies
And leave a spray of diamonds
In its wake
I long to see St. Judy's Comet
Sparkle in your eyes
When you awake Little boy
Won't you lay your body down
Little boy
Won't you close your weary eyes
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies Well I sang it once
And I sang it twice
I'm going to sing it three times more
Going to stay til your resistance
Is overcome
Cause if I can't sing my boy to sleep
Well it makes your famous daddy
Look so dumb Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
Roll across the skies
And leave a spray of diamonds
In its wake
I long to see St. Judy's Comet
Sparkle in your eyes
When you awake Little boy, little boy
Won't you lay your body down
Little boy, little boy
Won't you close your weary eyes
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies Oo Little sleepy boy
Do you know what time it is?
Well the hour of your bedtime's
Long been past
Though I know you're fighting it
I can tell when you rub your eyes
That you're fading fast One and one-half wandering Jews
Free to wander wherever they choose
Are traveling together
In the Sangre de Christo
The Blood of Christ Mountains
Of New Mexico
On the last leg of a journey
They started a long time ago
The arc of a love affair
Rainbows in the high desert air
Mountain passes
Slipping into stone
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones Thinking back to the season before
Looking back through the cracks in the door
Two people were married
The act was outrageous
The bride was contagious
She burned like a bride
These events may have had some effect
On the man with the girl by his side
The arc of a love affair
His hands rolling down her hair
Love like lightning shaking till it moans
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones Whoa whoa whoa
She said why?
Why don't we drive through the night
We'll wake up down in
Mexico
Oh I
I don't know nothin' about nothin'
About Mexico
And tell me why
Why won't you love me
For who I am
Where I am He said 'cause that's not the way the world is baby
This is how I love you baby
This is how I love you baby One and one-half wandering Jews
Returned to their natural coasts
To resume old acquaintances
Step out occasionally
And speculate who had been damaged the most
Easy time will determine if these consolations
Will be their reward
The arc of a love affair
Waiting to be restored
You take two bodies and you twirl them into one
Their hearts and their bones
And they won't come undone
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones
Hearts and bones Peace like a river ran through the city
Long past the midnight curfew
We sat starry-eyed
We were satisfied And I remember
Misinformation followed us like a plague
Nobody knew from time to time
If the plans where changed
If the plans were changed You can beat us with wires
You can beat us with chains
You can run out your rules
But you know you can't outrun the history train
I've seen a glorious day Four in the morning
I woke up from out of my dreams
Nowhere to go but back to sleep
But I'm reconciled Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna be up for a while
Oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna be up for a while C'mon take me to the Mardi Gras
Where the people sing and play
Where the dancing is elite
And there's music in the street
Both night and day Hurry take me to the Mardi Gras
In the city of my dreams
You can legalize your lows
You can wear your summer clothes
In the New Orleans And I will lay my burden down
Rest my head upon that shore
And when I wear that starry crown
I won't be wanting anymore Take your burdens to the Mardi Gras
Let the music wash your soul (let it wash your soul)
You can mingle in the street
You can jingle to the beat
Of Jelly Roll Toomba, toomba, toomba, Mardi Gras
Toomba, toomba, toomba, hey
Hey In my little town, I grew up believing
God keeps his eye on us all.
And he used to lean upon me as I pledged allegiance to the wall.
Lord, I recall, in my little town,
Comin' home after school, flyin' my bike past the gates of the factories,
My mom doin' the laundry, hangin' out shirts in the dirty breeze.
And after it rains there's a rainbow and all of the colors are black.
It's not that the colors aren't there, it's just imagination they lack.
Everything's the same back in my little town,
My little town, my little town. Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. In my little town, I never meant nothin',
I was just my father's son. mmm.
Savin' my money, dreamin' of glory,
Twitchin' like a finger on the trigger of a gun. Leavin' nothin' but the dead and dying back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town.
Nothin' but the dead and dyin' back in my little town. Hey, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam Yesterday I got a letter from my friend
Fighting in Vietnam
And this is what he had to say
'Tell all my friends that I'll be coming home soon
My time it'll be up some time in June
Don't forget, he said to tell my sweet Mary
Her golden lips as sweet as cherries And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
Don't be alarmed, she told me the telegram said
But mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Somebody please stop that war now It was just the next day his mother got a telegram
It was addressed from Vietnam
Now mistress Brown, she lives in the USA
And this is what she wrote and said
Don't be alarmed, she told me the telegram said
Oh, but mistress Brown your son is dead And it came from
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Somebody please stop it Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
What I'm saying now somebody stop that war What I dream I had, dressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline, of smoky Burgundy
Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets, down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells, tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on And when you ran to me your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
Oh I love you, girl Oh, I love you She was beautiful as southern skies the night he met her
She was married to someone
He was doggedly determined that he would get her
He was old she was young From time to time
He'd tip his heart
But each time she withdrew
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true Well eventually the boy and the girl get married
Sure enough they have a son
And though they were both occupied with the child she carried
Disagreements had begun And in a while
They fell apart
It wasn't hard to do
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true Two disappointed believers
Two people playing the game
Negotiations and love songs
Are often mistaken for one and the same Now the man and the woman they remain in contact
Let us say it's for the child
With disagreements about the meaning of a marriage contract
Conversations hard and wild But from time to time he makes her laugh
She cooks a meal of two
Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
Everybody thinks it's true What is the point of this story
What information pertains
The thought that life could be better
Is woven indelibly
Into our hearts and our brains We were married on a rainy day
The sky was yellow
And the grass was gray
We signed the papers
And we drove away
I do it for your love The rooms were musty
And the pipes were old
All that winter we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice
That we could hold
I do it for your love Found a rug
In an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way the colors ran
The orange bled the blue The sting of reason
The splash of tears
The northern and the southern
Hemispheres Love emerges
And it disappears
I do it for your love
I do it for your love A passenger traveling quietly conceals himself
With a magazine and a sleepless pillow
Over the crest of the mountains the moon
Begins its climb And he wakes to find he's in rolling farm land The farmer sleeps against his wife
He wonders what their life must be
A trailways bus is heading south into
Washington, D.C. A mother and child, the baby maybe two
Months old
Prepare themselves for sleep and feeding
The shadow of the capitol dome
Slides across his face
And his heart is racing with the urge to
Freedom
The father motionless as stone
A shepherd resting with his flock
The trailways bus is turning west
Dallas via Little Rock Oh my darling darling Sal
The desert moon is my witness
I've no money to come east
But I know you'll soon be here We pull into downtown Dallas by the
Sight of the grassy knoll
Where the leader fell and a town was broken
Away from the feel and flow of life for so many years
He hears music playing and Spanish spoken The border patrol outside of Tucson boarded the bus
Any aliens here you better check with us
How about you son you like you've got
Spanish blood
Do you habla inglese? Am I understood Yes I am an alien from Mars
I come to earth from outer space
And if I traveled my whole life
You guys would still be on my case
You guys would still be on my case But he can't leave his fears behind
He recalls each fatal thrust
The screams are carried by the wind
Phantom figures in the dust
Phantom figures in the dust
Phantom figures in the dust Whoa I got time on my hands tonight
You're the girl of my dreams
When I'm near you my future seems bright Oh I want you to be my girl
I want you to be my movie
I am Sal Mineo and I need you so
Sweet Bernadette Whoa you got style from your hair to your heels
Though my words may be jumbled
Still I'm telling you just how it feels I love you
I love you And the breeze that wraps around you
Satin summer nights
A girl I can't forget
Whoa you're the smile of the moon Bernadette Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home Wop, wop, wop, wop
Come with me
There's a place I want you to see When the leaves are dark
I've got a hiding place in central park
And the sky is a coat of diamonds There's a wooden cross over my bed
The city is lit with candles
They're shining for you Bernadette Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oo oo, Bernadette Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home
Dom dom dom doo
Well-a well I'm home Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on But feel the bite
Whenever you believe that
You'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends
And the song ends
She moves on I know the reason I
Feel so blessed
My heart still splashes
Inside my chest, but she
She is like a top
She cannot stop
She moves on A sympathetic stranger
Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks
She jumps back
But she moves on She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ?? Then I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
And I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes She can't sleep now
The moon is red
She fights a fever
She burns in bed
She needs to talk so
We take a walk
Down in the maroon light She says â??Maybe these emotions are
As near to love as love will ever beâ??
So I agree
Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on She says â??Ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discoverâ?? Then I fall to my knees
I grow weak, I go slack
As if she'd captured the breath of my
Voice in a bottle
And I can't catch it back But I feel good
It's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the run way
A cloud shifts
The plane lifts
She moves on Slow down, you movin' too fast
You gotta make the moment last
Just kickin' down the cobblestones
Lookin' for fun and
Feelin' groovy____________ Hello lampost
Whatcha knowin?
I've come to watch your flowers growin'
Ain'tcha got no rhymes for me?
Doo Bee Doo Doo,
Feelin' groovy____________ Got no deeds to do
No promises to keep
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep
Let the morningtime drop all its petals on me...
Life, I love you,
All is groovy____________________ When I think back
On all the crap I learned in high school
It's a wonder
I can think at all
And though my lack of education
Hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away If you took all the girls I knew
When I was single
And brought them all together for one night
I know they'd never match
My sweet imagination
Everything looks worse in black and white Kodachrome
They give us those nice bright colors
They give us the greens of summers
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Mama don't take my Kodachrome away
Mama don't take my Kodachrome
Leave your boy so far from home

Sloped into the room
He said I have no opinion about this
And I have no opinion about that Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon
He said well I don't claim to be happy about this, boys

It's all over the evening news
All about the fire in your life
On the evening news I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love

I say the joke is on her
I said I have no opinion about that
Well, we'll just have to wait and confer I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of your love
I don't want no part of this crazy love
I don't want no part of this crazy love If a baby is born and no one complains
Then that's good luck, runnin' through young veins
And if life is a blessing
That brushes the tops of the trees
Well it's a short walk, in a sweet breeze I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma If the heart is an open memory book
That was the chance I took
The more I searched
The more I shook for Thelma Last night I slept on a rented pillow
A silver moon above my head
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed Now the first time that I saw you I thought
She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught
People aware of my history
Trying to steer you away from me
I left a message at your hotel
Don't let management poison the well I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma The phone is ringing and I realize
We are time zones and oceans apart
The words I speak in the middle of my night
Fall on your yesterday's heart If the sun don't shine
If the wind don't break
If the clock don't jump off the wall
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall I will need you, feed you,
Seed you, plead with you
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair
For a long time, now
And I don't care I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed
The baby curled up in a ball
Winter sunlight hits the family tree
And everything else becomes nothing at all It was the morning of October 6th, 1960
I was wearing my brown suit
Preparing to leave the house of D.
Shook some hands then adios Brooklyn amigos
Maybe some of them had hopes of seeing me again
Some even said that my judge Judge Gerald Culkin
Wouldn't play it by the book
Maybe let us off the hook
But wooo I knew better Salvador
Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood
The blancos and the nigger gangs
Well they'd kill us if they could Aurea & Women
Angel of Mercy, people are suffering
All over the world
Spanish children are taught on their knees to believe
Angel of Mercy, people are suffering
All over the island tonight
Mothers weep, sisters grieve Sal
Well, I entered the courtroom, state of New York
County of New York, just some spic
They scrubbed off the sidewalk
Guilty by my dress
Guilty in the press
Let the Capeman burn for the murders Salvador
The 'Spanish boys' had their day in court room Sal
And now it was time for some fuckin' law and order
"The electric chair
For the greasy pair?"
Said the judge to the court reporter Salvador
Afraid to leave the projects
To cross into another neighborhood
The newspapers and the TV crews
Well they'd kill you if they could Aurea & Women
Angel of Mercy, well people are suffering
All over the world Sal
A Spanish boy could be killed every night of the week
But just let some white boy die
And the world goes crazy for blood--latin blood
I don't lie when i speak Sal & Salvador
Well they shackled my hands
A heavy belt around my waist to restrain me Sal
And they shackled my legs
Hernandez, the "Umbrella Man" chained beside me
Then we rode that black mariah trough the streets of Spanish Harlem Salvador
Calling old friends on the corners
Just to lay our prayers upon them Crying adios pisanos, adios
Adios pisanos, adios You got to learn how to fall
Before you learn to fly
And mama, mama it ain't no lie
Before you learn to fly
Learn how to fall You got to drift in the breeze
Before you set your sails
It's an occupation where the wind prevails
Before you set your sails
Drift in the breeze Oh and it's the same old story
Ever since the world began
Everybody got the runs for glory
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan You got to learn how to fall
Before you learn to fly
The tank towns they tell no lie
Before you learn to fly
Learn how to fall Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence "Fools", said I, "You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in the sounds of silence Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives a former talk-show host
Everybody knows his name He says there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
I've seen them all and man
They're all the same Well, the sun gets weary
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up On the black pit town
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you This is all around the world Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere
There's a former army post
Abandoned now just like the war
And there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's what that old army post was for Well, the sun gets bloody
And the sun goes down
Ever since the watermelon
And the lights come up On the black pit town
Somebody says what's a better thing to do
Well, it's not just me
And it's not just you This is all around the world Over the mountain
Down in the valley
Lives the former talk-show host
Far and wide his name was known
He said there's no doubt about it
It was the myth of fingerprints
That's why we must learn to live alone Down among the reeds and rushes
A baby boy was found
His eyes as clear as centuries
His silky hair was brown Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time Me and my buddies we are traveling people
We like to go down to restaurant row
Spend those Euro-dollars
All the way from Washington to Tokyo
I see them in the airport lounge
Upon their mother's breast
They follow me with open eyes
Their uninvited guest Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time Too many people on the bus from the airport
Too many holes in the crust of the earth
The planet groans
Every time it registers another birth But down among the reeds and rushes
A baby girl was found
Her eyes as clear as centuries
Her silky hair was brown Never been lonely
Never been lied to
Never had to scuffle in fear
Nothing denied to
Born at the instant
The church bells chime
And the whole world whispering
Born at the right time No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I can't for the life of me
Remember a sadder day
I know they say let it be
But it just don't work out that way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again No I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
But the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away, oh, little darling of mine I just can't believe it's so
Though it seems strange to say
I never been laid so low
In such a mysterious way
And the course of a lifetime runs
Over and over again But I would not give you false hope
On this strange and mournful day
When the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a motion away
Oh the mother and child reunion
Is only a moment away Went to my doctor yesterday
She said I seem to be OK
She said
Paul you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think you can
Do what you been doin'
Who you foolin? I came back home and I went to bed
I was resting my head
My wife came in and she said
What's wrong sweet boy what's wrong?
Ah, I told her what's wrong
I said Peg you better look around
How long you think you can
Run that body down
How many nights you think you can
Do what you been doin'
Now, who you foolin? Kid you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think you can
Do what you been doin'
Who you foolin? He was a mean individual
He had a heart like a bone
He was a naturally crazy man
And better off left alone Well he stopped one night
At a traffic light
And when that light turned green
He was a mean individual
Stranded in a limousine Hey hey hey hey
All the children on the street
They come running out their front doors
Running out their back doors
Flying on their feet
They said mama, oh! Papa, oh!
See what I have seen
There's a mean individual stranded in a limousine Then everybody came running
Everybody said Lord, Lord!
Everybody was gunning
They're gonna divvy up the reward
And then a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
A siren, a flashing light
But the mean individual
Had vanished in the black of night Hey hey hey hey
They wondered where to begin
'Cause he left that neighborhood
Just like the rattlesnake sheds its skin Well they searched the roofs
And they checked out the groups
And they photographed the scene
For the mean individual
Stranded in a limousine Then everybody came running
Everybody said Lord, Lord!
Everybody was gunning
They're gonna divvy up the reward
And then a wah wah wah wah wah wah wah
A siren, a flashing light
But the mean individual
Had vanished in the black of night
The mean individual had vanished in the black of night
The mean individual had vanished in the black of night! Lord I am a working man
And music is my trade
I'm traveling with this 5 piece band
I play the ace of spades
I have a wife and family, don't see much of me
God bless the absentee Lord I am a surgeon
And music is my knife
It cuts away my sorrow
And purifies my life
But if I could release my heart
From veins and arteries
I'd say God bless the absentee I miss my woman so
I miss my bed
I miss those soft places
I used to lay my head My son don't need me yet
His bones are soft
He flies a silver airplane
He wears a golden cross God bless the absentee Lord
This country's changed so fast
The future is the present
The present's in the past
The highways are in litigation
The airports disagree
God bless the absentee Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
Was a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies He was a navy man
Stationed in Newport news
She was a high school queen
With nothing left to lose Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
Was a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies Her name was Lorelei
She was his only girl
She called him Speedoo
But his christian name
Was Mr. Earl Was a sunny day
Not a cloud was in the sky
Not a negative word was heard
From the people passing by
Was a sunny day
All the birdies in the trees
And the radio's singing song
All the favorite melodies If you leap awake
In the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memory upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star I believe a light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever
And though I cant guarantee
There's nothing scary hiding under your bed
I'm gonna stand guard like a postcard
At the Golden Retriever
And never leave till I leave you
With a sweet dream in your bed Chorus:
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you'll always know
As long as one and one is two wooo
There could never be a father who loved
His daughter more than I love you Trust your intuition
It's just like goin fishin'
You cast your line and hope you get a bite
You don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the market place
Trying to help the human race
Strugglin to survive its harshest hour chorus
x2 There's been some hard feelings here
About some words that were said
There's been some hard feelings here
And what is more
There's been a bloody purple nose
And some bloody purple clothes
That were messing up the lobby floor
It's just apartment house rules
So all you 'partment fools
Remember: one man's ceiling
Is another man's floor
Remember: one man's ceiling
Is another man's floor There's been some strange goin's on
And some folks have come and gone
And the elevator man don't work no more
I heard a racket in the hall
And I thought I heard a fall
But I never opened up my door
It's just apartment house sense
It's like apartment rents
Remember: one man's ceiling
Is another man's floor
Remember: one man's ceiling
Is another man's floor And there's an alley
In the back of my building
Where some people congregate in shame
I was walking with my dog
And the night was black with smog
When I thought I heard somebody
Call my name The first time I heard â??Peggy Sueâ??
I was 12 years old
Russians up in rocket ships
And the war was cold
Now many wars have come and gone
Genocide still goes on
Buddy Holly still goes on
But his catalog was sold First time I smoked
Guess what, paranoid
First time I heard â??Satisfactionâ??
I was young and unemployed
Down the decades every year
Summer leaves and my birthday's here
And all my friends stand up and cheer
And say Man you're old
Getting old
Old
Getting old We celebrate the birth of Jesus on Christmas day
And Buddha found nirvana along the lotus way
About 1,500 years ago the messenger Mohammad spoke
And his wisdom like a river flowed
Through hills of gold
Wisdom is old
The Koran is old
The Bible's old
Greatest story ever told Disagreements?
Work 'em out The human race has walked the earth for 2.7 million
And we estimate the universe at 13-14 billion
When all these numbers tumble into your imagination
Consider that the Lord was there before creation
God is old
We're not old
God is old
He made the mold Take your clothes off
Adam and Eve Moves like a fist through traffic
Anger and no one can heal it
Shoves a little bump into the momentum
It's just a little lump
But you feel it
In the creases and the shadows
With a rattling deep emotion
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean Yes boss, the government handshake
Yes boss, the crusher of language
Yes boss, Mr. Stillwater
The face at the edge of the banquet
The cool, the cool river
The cool, the cool river I believe in the future
I may live in my car
My radio tuned to
The voice of a star
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm
And these old hopes and fears
Still at my side Anger and no one can heal it
Slides through the metal detector
Lives like a mole in a motel
A slide in a slide projector
The cool, cool river
Sweeps the wild, white ocean
The rage of love turns inward
To prayers of devotion
And these prayers are
The constant road across the wilderness
These prayers are
These prayers are the memory of God
The memory of God And I believe in the future
We shall suffer no more
Maybe not in my lifetime
But in yours I feel sure
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm
And these streets
Quiet as a sleeping army
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven
For the mother's restless son
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior
Who denies his urge to break and run Who says: Hard times?
I'm used to them
The speeding planet burns
I'm used to that
My life's so common it disappears
And sometimes even music
Cannot substitute for tears Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsely, sage, rosemary & thyme
(Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground)
Without no seams nor needlework
(Blankets and bedclothes a child of the mountains)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves)
Parsely, sage, rosemary, & thyme
(Washed is the ground with so many tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions)
Parsely, sage, rosemary & thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
And to gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
Parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine. We sailed up a river wide as a sea
And slept on the banks
On the leaves of a banyan tree
And all of these spirit voices rule the night Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Songs from the mouth of the river
When the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night By moon
We walk
To the brujo's door
Along a path of river stone
Women with their nursing children
Seated on the floor
We join the fevers
And the broken bones The candlelight flickers
The falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy â?? heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night My hands are numb
My feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
The sweetness in the air
Combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo Saudocoes -- Greetings!
Da licenca um momento -- Excuse me, one moment
Te lembro -- I remind you
Que amanha -- That tomorrow
Sera tudo ou sera naoa -- It will be all or it will be nothing
Depende coracao -- It depends, heart
Sera breve ou sera grande -- It will be brief or it will be great
Depende da paixao -- It depends on the passion
Sera sujo, sera sonho -- It will be dirty, it will be a dream
Cuidado, coracao -- Be careful, heart
Sera util, sera tarde -- It will be useful, it will be late
Se esmera, coracao -- Do your best, heart
E confia -- And have trust
Na forca do amanha -- In the power of tomorrow Lord of the earthquake
My trembling bed
The spider resumes the rhythm
Of his golden tread
And all of these spirit voices rule the night He was my brother
Five years older than I
He was my brother
Twenty-three Years old the day he died Freedom writer
They cursed my brother to his face
Go home outsider
This town's gonna be your buryin' place He was singin' on his knees
An angry mob trailed along
They shot my brother dead
Because he hated what was wrong He was my brother
Tears can't bring him back to me
He was my brother
And he died so his brothers could be free
He died so his brothers could be free Begin again
No easy trick
Without a guide or walking stick
Begin before the bells of twilight peal
Downhill town
The road ahead
Spiral, as a serpent's bed
A teaspoon of desire for my meal I trade my tears
To ask the Lord
For proof of love
If only for the consolation
Of gazing at the stars above
Amen, amen, amen
The road is steep
The air is thin
I hear a voice inside my skin
Don't be afraid Your days won't end with night
Feel the sun
Drink the rain
Let your body heal its pain
Bathe beneath a waterfall of light
I trade my tears
To ask the Lord
For proof of love If only for the explanation
That tells me what my dreams are made of
Amen, amen
The valley below
An ocean of debris
I ask the Lord
For proof of love
Love is all I seek
Love is all I seek And when at times my words desert me
Music is the tongue I speak
I rest my head beside a white oak tree
No deadly nightshade, Belladonna
Dare lay a leaf on me
Silent night
Still as prayer
Darkness fills with light
Love on Earth is everywhere I was having this discussion
In a taxi heading downtown
Rearranging my position
On this friend of mine who had A little bit of a breakdown
I said breakdowns come
And breakdowns go
So what are you going to do about it That's what I'd like to know
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could It was in the early morning hours
When I fell into a phone call
Believing I had supernatural powers
I slammed into a brick wall I said hey, is this my problem?
Is this my fault?
If that's the way it's going to be
I'm going to call the whole thing to a halt You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could I was walking down the street
When I thought I heard this voice say
Say, ain't we walking down the same street together
On the very same day I said hey Senorita that's astute
I said why don't we get together
And call ourselves an institute You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could
You don't feel you could love me
But I feel you could - I was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown The smartest people in the world
Had gathered in Los Angeles
To analyze our love affair
And possibly unscramble us
And we sat among our photographs
Examined every one
And in the end we compromised
And met the morning sun Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much They say the left side of the brain
Dominates the right
And the right side has to labor
Through the long and speechless night
And in the night
My father came to me
And held me to his chest
He said there's not much more that you can do
Go on and get some rest
And I said yeah Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much
Maybe I think too much Soon our fortunes will be made, my darling
And we leave this loathsome little town
Silver bells jingling from your black lizard boots, my baby
Silver foil to trim your wedding gown It's true the tools of love wear down
Time passes
A mind wanders
It seems mindless, but it does
Sometimes I see your face
As if through reading glasses
And your smile seems softer than it was Proof
Some people gonna call you up
Tell you something that you already know
Proof
Sane people go crazy on you
Say "No man that was not
The deal we made
I got to go, I got to go"
Faith
Faith is an island in the setting sun
But proof, yes
Proof is the bottom line for everyone My face, my race
Don't matter anymore
My sex, my cheques
Accepted at the door Proof
Some people gonna call you up
Tell you something that you already know
Proof
Sane people go crazy on you
Say "No man that was not
The deal we made
I got to, I got to go"
Faith
Faith is an island in the setting sun
But proof, yes
Proof is the bottom line for everyone Half moon hiding in the clouds, my darling
And the sky is flecked with signs of hope
Raise your weary wings against the rain, my baby
Wash your tangled curls with gambler's soap Proof
Some people gonna call you up
Tell you something that you already know
Proof
Sane people go crazy on you
Say "No man that was not
The deal we made
I got to, I got to, I got to"
Faith
Faith is an island in the setting sun
But proof, yes
Proof is the bottom line for everyone I am heading for a time of quiet
When my restlessness is past
And I can lie down on my blanket
And release my fists at last I am heading for a time of solitude
Of peace without illusions
When the perfect circle
Marries all beginnings and conclusions And when they say
That you're not good enough
Well the answer is
You're not
But who are they
Or what is it
That eats at what you've got
With the hunger of ambition
For the change inside the purse
They are handcuffs on the soul, my friends
Handcuffs on the soul
And worse I am heading for a place of quiet
Where the sage and sweet grass grow
By a lake of sacred water
From the mountain's melted snow
