Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we come mashing out her man's seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like eighty chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches posting niggas like they were wedding pictures

Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule its only room for improvement
And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga

We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts

But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow

Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap

Hit the trick, jump the track

Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
Me and forty back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations,
I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking, watch me take it All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
And it's double M G until I get the chair All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told ya I'm on one, yeah,
Fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be gotten and I'ma get that shit
Cause I'm on one, I said fuck it I'm on one I walk around the club,

You know the feds listening,

You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the swishas

Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to the world like Mayans

It's a slim chance I fall, olive oil
Tunechi be the name, don't ask me how I got it
I'm killin' these hoes I swear I'm tryna stop the violence All I care about is money and the city that I'm from

Still in the trap but like my bitches bougie
Two cups of Styrofoam, excuse me little mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want Celine
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting Seen the two G-wagons in my driveway
Facetime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shopping in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got the see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes
We the best and I told you this back in '05
(Maybach Music) I'm just trying to get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind? Oh, just in case you need me
I don't mind
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do, tell them what to do
When you see a bad bitch in front of you baby
Assume the position I'm just trying to get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night

And like Rihanna fine ass, I'm gon' live my life
Ten bands and take one, call it being nice
Get your hands up and that's a direct order
Got my bands up, thanks to the transporter
Thanks to the transporter?

With all the jewelry on, make sure I'm looking good
Rob who nigga? I wish a nigga would
Point 5, don't shoot, that's how the lames do it
Word on the street somebody put a hit on me
I'm in the foreign, top off, look like I'm worried homie?
Better send them now, got bout a mill on me
You rob me; I kill you, now that's a deal homie
Two-twenty-three
Carbon one-five
Old black bitch with me, that's that forty five
Been real, never snitched nigga my whole life
Heard a nigga whacked him. He shouldn't have testified [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!

Put em up! I'm hotter than a Kawasaki in the projects
Burning more than rubber, money ain't a object
I'm number 1, and hurt they feelings in the process
Cop a bird, then your really seein progress
I'm buying cars like I'm in a contest
Say my name, rappers lookin like a bomb threat
I'm the winner, these beginners talking nonsense
Brain from your ? till she render me unconscious
I'm so conscious of DNA in my closet
My show account can't take another deposit
Ladies heartthrob labelled me the odd ball
3.5 cause I'm known to start small [Chorus]
If you from the streets like me, put your hands up!
D Boys on my tease, put your hands up!
Independent bad bitches, put your hands up!
If you know this how you living, put your hands up!
Where they at?
Put em up! If you know this how you living, put your hands up!

Another victory for the crib
A couple more before I'm done
And if you asleep you better wake up
And get on your fuckin' job

Pussy so wet I'mma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining
Boy I light the block up, young Billie Jeaning
I'm dodging the leeches, I'm signing agreements
I'm signing new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimming with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixing, this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side
How many times? Pour a cup for the bitches that ain't scared to get down
Get down, get down
How many times I gotta?
Light another for the bitches who's just only in town
For the weekend, ohh I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwing bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feeling generous, throwing my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, "Bingo!" the minute I'm boning
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the morning
Got xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, gripping it, backing me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwing
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinking Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, dropping that ass to a split
Talking 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whipping the bricks How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
How many times I gotta tell that ass to come over?
I'll fuck you right, have you walking from side to side

Hey, yeah (we the best) All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there (Luda!)
Ludacris goin' in on the verse
Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky for the homies
That didn't make it and the folks locked down
I never went no where
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that Conjure
The hood call it Luda-Yac
And I'm on this foolish track, so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booty's go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix, now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got twenty bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the south's champion
Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I
All I do is All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah

Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Swerving in my lo-lo,
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my n****s call me Loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at
Represent that mud life (mud life)
Dirty money b**** you better get your mug right (mug right)
We come together holding hands and holla thug life (thug life)
We all strapped in all black
It's like f*** life
(All we do is win)
You riding or what (what!)
'Cause we riding tonight (night!)
Now she riding with me cause you wasn't ridin' her right, All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win win win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make 'em stay there Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been runnin' this rap game since I was twenty years old
I hung with the worst of 'em
Bust till I burst on 'em
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossin' up, pressure up, bless ya bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the "U" in the 80's
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, get it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
B**** I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the buildin'
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah

Two seaters every season, and I just begun
Aquafina, she dripping puddles on a sunny day
Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways
Fuck a fashion, we come mashing out her man's seats
Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached
Say no names, Supreme underwear, and like eighty chains
Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change
Petty bitches posting niggas like they were wedding pictures
Evidently, I'm getting richer, tricking seven figures
Ain't no difference when you see or that's on television
Chasing a hundred million, baby that's my natural ambition
Boss All my life, that's on everything, yeah
This forever, I put that on everything, yeah

That's on my life, yeah, yeah I took my life and bossed it up
I took the risk, coin tossed it up
I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic
I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs
Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false
I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face
Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate
No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list
There's no room off in the schedule its only room for improvement
And I realized all I needed was in me, nigga
S on my chest boy, so shots can't even pinch me, nigga
No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me nigga
God is in me, that's the only one who can end me nigga
And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer
My daddy says you got a good girl, she's a keeper
Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it
Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ethered
Yeah, they don't really fucking feel me man, but when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles
I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me
That mean I got the Holy Key and the key to the city, lil' nigga All my life, that's on everything, yeah

Doing what I gotta do
What up though?
We the best music
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go
DJ Khaled Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement with you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
(The holy key, the holy key, the holy key) And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'mma celebrate it for a long time
The drama couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (Uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubix cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches, sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD

Only say "I love you" just so I can hear it back
Sometimes, other times I'd love to have you back
Can't think of a night that we ain't turn up to the max
To the max, no

Nigga!! [Chorus] Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic
DJ Khaled! A divine leader
Shine brighter, bonita mami meet a line sniffer
Never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show
Big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin
A lot of niggas owe me, I'mma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
'Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin'
My neck was still freezin', now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin' it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my go supporters, go support us
Like a local black-owned grocery store
'Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that
We get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance, so we can lease and own Ds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies
Niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy with a loaded pistol
Y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers
Check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key Another one

Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I'm here to nurture, I wanna take you further

Fuck with me baby, it's Tunechi baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I'm rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch I'm King Kong
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone
Pop a pill and pop that pussy

And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest

Now we gon' get fucked up, no excuses no apologies Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled! Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah! My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do 'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world), cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cold), a cold cold world Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Where I surrender to you, (surrender) surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do
Oh-oh oh whoa
Oh-oh (oh-oh) oh-oh See there's a story in my life (Surrender)
There's a story in my pain (Surrender)
There's a story in my tears (Surrender)
There's a story in me (I won't Surrender, I won't surrender, oh no no no) [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I could If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Fuck nigga you can't stop this)
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain [Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard [Kanye West]
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ugh were do I start
First I stand around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't no body get up on it

Nigga how sick
Sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip
Fly as 57 passenges
This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it [Chorus] [Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here [Chorus] [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in I go hard, for the hood

I go hard for the ghetto
Kanye West T-Pain DJ Khaled

Bentyaga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun cock it back then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sadity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spent three hundred thousand or better that's on all the cars
That Maybach park itself, nigga
That range rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back I'm eating filet mignon
He been .44'ing all year I put the Rollie on
Trapping good all year put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets you gotta keep a drum
Said a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga, I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a Spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya
I got the clappers, finessers, and the trappers
Before the rap shit, you gotta go dap 'em
Don't forget to look a nigga when they after ya I told Future I can see the future
Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you
I know I'm blessed nigga Hallelujah
I'm grateful and if you diss me then I might shoot ya
Brrr you don't fuck with me the feeling mutual
Fuck you, half these rap niggas owe the jeweler (fuck 'em)
I was selling keys to success

New Wraith with the stars in it
New Porsche, condo, living room cars in it
Ace of Spades with the Percocet and bars in it
Real soldiers, young shooters put they heart in it
They talk 'bout all this money we make and all these niggas they hatin'
Let's talk 'bout runnin' that bag up fast 'cause we ain't got no patience
Let's talk 'bout poppin' strips and xans like we 're patients
And the fed's allegations have you pacin'
Million dollar dope boy I gotta be grateful
You tryna get that 100 mil I'mma race you
Dope boy, I ain't never wanna be a rap nigga
Billboard reporter "LA Reid just sign a trap nigga"
New York Times read "Jay Z just signed a trap nigga"
Kitchen like "it's Thursday, you heard?" Might bring it back nigga
You fuckin' the money up if I'm being honest
Gotta be grateful I never break the promise
I know my plug love me, I know my bitch hate me
I heard my hood salty I tried to tell 'em it ain't my fault
It's just my blessings called me
But since they hatin' on an nigga I'mma keep ballin'
And I ain't textin' that bitch back because she keep stallin'
If she ain't fuck the first night then she just miss her callin'
Fuck a plea, I'm goin' to trial poker face I'm all in
Patek Philippe, the AP, 40 mil I'm all in
Plug hit my line I act like I ain't see 'em callin'

And I done seen so many people change up
I can't relate, I can't relate, no

Those were my demons
Those were my demons
Forgive me, father
Those were my demons Folarin
Major Key, special cloth I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last 223 thousand hours
And it's cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free!
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I should made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat flat
And your ass on what's that?
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in them, man I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet I always wonder if you ask yourself
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Or is this sex so good I shouldn't have to fuck for free?
Is it just me?
Yeah, is it just me?
Is this sex so good I shouldn't have to
(Would you fuck me for free?) Another one
They don't want me to have another anthem
So I made sure I got another anthem
It's We The Best OVO
Summers ours

Don't ever play yourself
One time for Future the Prince
One time for 40
One time for Drake
Another one
Bless up Yeah
We The Best Music
DJ Khaled Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push, I'm more Eric B
I ain't no joke, check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But 2 million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all grace been driven
G Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said it's written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat versus lean, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke or these pills, the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts

My life's a dream to rappers
Afraid they moments have past 'em
It's all different hustle (straight up)
Niggas movin' bricks
Young niggas rappin', doin' shows, hittin' they licks
Everybody hold this money in thicks
Don't get robbed, boy, is you dumb?
All them swipers gettin' it how it come (Yep)
43, morally ambiguous, you serious?
Gettin' it, lyricist, idiots, you ain't nearin' this
Out of New York's biggest and richest
I'm the template, low-key the busiest
The game chose me, deal with it
So I'm the quiet type, Mr. One Mic

Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
After they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you
(Excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it
Track record so impressive
Open the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie I just got back from where they said I couldn't get back from
And I thank God, I thank God that I made it
They surprised, they surprised that I made it

Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin' in my pockets
It ain't trickin' if you got it
And since a niqqa from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly sh!t
And I'm a history major
Hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left

The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next

Queens bridge represent state one
Nigga I'm on (come on!)

Chopard wrist band
New York crown jewel
No if and's
Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four
And the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul
I'm quicksand
I'm 5 Mics, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight
But we ain't beefin' tonight
That's history
So now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery
Like six degrees or the seven hills of Sicily
I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me
But nothing is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a Somalian
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next

We have a power
We are alive Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin' over skyscrapers, wildin' out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows
The Narco Gestapo Optimo's
Cause I love the dough
More than you know
Still ain't reach the pinnacle
Braveheart general since 9-4
Got the belt to show
Certified classic
9-6, Street Dreams is blastin'
And no way, they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin'
I'm so platinum, it's natural
A niqqa is my acronym
Lights, camera, action and It's still Nasty, bone in the flesh
God's son, never gone, never left
King, I play every card in the deck
The whole world waitin' for what I'm goin' do next
And y'all already know I came from

Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt

Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I'm out on bond I might be facin' eight's
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London as she screams

Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!

Ask you what you laughing at

Straight out the holy land to holdin' grams
Tra-tra-trappin' out stolen vans with goals and plans
Lonely man, remember bein' my only fan
I'm down and up, the Midas touch, the golden hand
Blood in the soil is over oil
Cold-hearted, my blood boils
The spoils of war are used to take the drugs out the foil
Man these arms can't reach you, AR's won't recoil
Goddamn, I might marry a heiress and move to Paris
Fuck the carriage baby, let's go disappear and just perish
Thirty karats in the gold
I wear it to cherish the kings from which we inherit
My chariot is McLaren
It's all numeric
Talkin' numbers, you incoherent
Don't be embarrassed, I blame your parents for even caring
Or not aborting, ah fuck it, it's not important
My vital organs can't even tell if it's night or morning
Final warning, final warning, final warning
Every morning you'll awake and await mourning
We earn it then we burn it to ash
I call it urn money
My dog called 40 before he turned 20
Money is earned, the rest is inherited
Hashish come from Marrakech, all my kush is American
Man I feel like a therapist, pistol on me like Maravich
I careless, I'm so perilous with all of this arrogance, goddamn
Money, hoes, that's something that you can't chase
I ain't shit but let you eat from the same plate
If you ungrateful then you ain't great
Me and Khaled come from the same place
Huh, holy land, holy land
Back when I was holdin' grams just to haul a Benz
Yeah, holy land, holy land
My father never was a holy man
